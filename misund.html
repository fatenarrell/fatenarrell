  <h1>Lost: Misunderstood</h1>
  <p>When most people think about Lost, they often think of it as a show that had great promise but ended up losing the plot. This is far from the truth, however. Back in 2004, people didn't have the time or care to tune in to the TV every week and remember every minute detail from an episode 6 weeks prior just to understand what was going on. As such, fans quickly lost interest after not understanding someone's actions or what something meant, and as a result, began ridiculing the show for making it up as it went along. Had it been released on a streaming service two decades later, Lost would have far lighter critiques and the reception towards the intertwining mysteries would be significantly more positive. As to the idea that the showrunners were making it up as they went along and that they themselves were lost, that is unfair and not true. Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse (the geniuses behind the success of Lost) had the sole mission of keeping Lost afloat for as long as they could all the while milking it for everything it had. In ABC's view, why would you ever end a show that was still raking in millions of views for an episode about a man's tattoos? The pair had to battle this, and as a result, the show was dragged on for 3 seasons after they had wanted to finish it. This is somewhat visible in the storylines and themes behind the later seasons becoming more outlandish and far-fetched than just a survival show, but binging the whole show within a matter of weeks will easily disprove anyone's claim that the showrunners made it up as they went along.</p>
<br>
<hr style="width:30%;margin:auto;">
<br>
<p>Lost's ending was satisfying, giving a (somewhat) happy ending to the characters we had been watching suffer for the past 6 years. Too, the idea that many of the show's storylines were left unanswered is just ridiculous; the claims are always made by people who never finished the show or were too dim to understand it. One of the most common things people bring up in contention with Lost being left unanswered is the case about the Polar Bears. In the second episode of the whole show, the gang is chased down by a Polar Bear before being shot dead by Sawyer. Critics still say there was never an explanation as to why a Polar Bear would exist on a tropical island, but as any fan of the show would tell you, there directly was! In the Orientation Video for Hydra Island, a one-armed Pierre Chang tells the audience that "Ursus maritimus, or Polar Bears, possess a key sense of memory and adaptability. These traits make them ideal candidates for electro-magnetic studies that will be conducted at a secondary site". The Dharma Initiative (the initiative in which Chang works) sought to harness and study the island for all it is capable of and specifically wanted to study the primary source of power from the island through the Polar Bears. Evidently, one of the subjects escaped (presumably after the Dharma Initiative purge) and had been living on the main island until encountering the Oceanic survivors. The case of the Polar Bears is just one of the storylines that many critics simply don't understand and call 'unanswered', despite their being a spoon-fed answer right there. I can promise you that if you watch the show all the way through, these supposed loose ties will cease to exist and you will become a fan.</p>

  <h1>Why Lost Works</h1>
  </div>
</div>


  <div class="relative3">
  <div class="intro3">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Michael Giacchino</b> - As Youtuber Drew Gooden puts it; "So many of the moments in this show can be triumphant or heart-wrenching on their own, but then you combine that with these beautiful strings, this big booming orchestra that comes in and crescendos over a scene; and you go from thinking "This is a pretty good show" to "Oh my god I'm already crying and its the third episode". And he is right. Without the genius that is Michael Giacchino being specially crafted for each scene and character, Lost would hardly be as memorable and impactful as it thankfully is. Instead of standard stock iMovie music playing while Jack, Charlie and Kate are running from a pillar of smoke in the first episode, Michael Giacchino shipped home pieces of the plane wreck to use in the soundtrack. Without the reminder of danger and the composition of suspense from Giacchino's work, Lost would cease to be as important in media as it is today.</li>
   <br>
    <li><b>Casting</b> - The casting for Lost was perfect. The actors and actresses who play our fan favourite Losties are spot on in relation to who they portray. Some of the main characters in Lost were even created just for the actors themselves. Jorge Garcia originally auditioned for Sawyer; a character whose harsh and unforgiving qualities are opposite from Hurley's, the character which was created just for Garcia himself. Josh Holloway who ended up playing  Sawyer auditioned for a sly New York conman. However as Holloway later revealed, he believes that the character was changed to a selfish, arrogant southern criminal after he kicked a chair due to forgetting his line during the audition process. Separately, nearly none of the main cast were established celebrities when Lost started. It was Evangeline Lilly's (Kate) first-ever leading role, only appearing in a dating hotline commercial prior. By not knowing what each actor was capable of, the audience was able to better connect to each character and explore them individually for the first time. This is in complete contrast to J.J. Abrams' first casting idea. It was the original plan to cast Michael Keaton as Jack and have him die in the first episode in place of the pilot. As a result, Kate would become the protagonist and leader of the group. However, the plan was changed when ABC officials thought killing off an important character so quickly would cause the audience to lose trust in the show, and as such, Michael Fox became our (alive) leader.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Relatability and Themes</b> - Because of Lost's diverse cast and (very) wide range of characters, every fan has at least someone they can connect to. This is due to every character purposefully being flawed - just as we all are. Even though Jack Shephard is a doctor with a grand moral compass, his flaw is his stubbornness, his need to make things right and his inability to let things go. This is shown very early on when Jack refuses to let the severely wounded Marhsall die despite him being in agony and having a tiny chance at living. Later in the series, this flaw comes back again. Even though successfully leaves the island as a part of the Oceanic Six, Jack turns to drugs and alcohol due to his disgust towards his actions of leaving the island without everyone else. His pleads with Kate that "We have to go back!" have become the staple of the Lost identity.</li>
