  <h2 id="season1">Season 1</h2>
    <p>
      On September 22, 2004, a plane breaks apart in mid-air, scattering survivors on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific. Forty-eight of these survivors, after the initial shock passes, attempt to set up a camp and figure out where they are but are disturbed by loud roaring noises and crashing trees emanating from the nearby jungle.
Three of the survivors, Jack, Kate, and Charlie, set out to find the plane's cockpit. An injured pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after takeoff, turned back for Fiji, and hit turbulence. The plane was a thousand miles off course when it crashed. The Monster rips the pilot from the cockpit, consequently killing him, and the remaining three run for the beach.
Jack, a spinal surgeon from Los Angeles, discovers a mugshot of Kate, with whom he has begun a close friendship. After initial mistrust and the death of the Marshal, whom he tries to save, both of them agree to start afresh.
One of the survivors, a former Iraqi Republican Guard communications officer named Sayid, attempts to repair the transceiver from the plane. A few survivors (Sayid, Boone, Shannon, Charlie, Kate, and Sawyer) trek high into the mountains in an attempt to get a signal and are attacked by a polar bear along the way. When they finally do turn on the transceiver, they learn that its signal is being blocked by a transmission of a woman's voice speaking in French, which Shannon translates as: "I'm alone now, on the island alone. Please someone come. The others are dead. It killed them. It killed them all." The message repeats with an automated count implying, according to Sayid's calculation, that it has been repeating for over sixteen years and five months. Coupled with the pilot's last words, the survivors' hopes of rescue are dampened; and despite the group trying to keep the discovery undercover, the news spreads through the camp throughout the first few days.
When food supplies run low, Locke leads the first hunting party for boar. As Kate's resourcefulness comes in handy, Michael and Walt, father and son, struggle to get along. On the sixth day, a woman drowns, and a young man named Boone tries to prove his worth. Jack goes on a spiritual quest when he begins to see visions of his deceased father on the island, and begins a science versus faith conflict with Locke. Eventually, the group of survivors split in half, whilst a few moved inland to a cluster of caves with fresh water and protection. Others stayed at the beach in hopes of rescue, and they moved once again when the tide began to carry the wreckage of the plane into the sea. Jack becomes the de facto leader. Intense rivalries emerge when disagreements on allocation of supplies becomes an issue, especially between Jack, Sayid and Sawyer. As conflict comes to head, Sawyer is tortured and then accidentally stabbed in the arm by Sayid, who then leaves the camp in shame for hurting Sawyer.He begins a journey of walking down the beach alone, telling Jack not to come after him.
Sayid finds a cable running out of the ocean and into the jungle. When he follows it, he encounters Danielle Rousseau, the French-speaking woman from the repeating transmission. She tells Sayid how she came to be on the Island, and implies she killed those she arrived with. Sayid eventually escapes with some of her papers, with potential knowledge of a group of hostile individuals, The Others, on the Island, who kidnapped Rousseau's baby daughter. Over the course of the season, Rousseau has other intermittent contact with the survivors.
Trying his best to make life on the island as comfortable as possible, Hurley conducts a census of the survivors when Claire is seemingly attacked 2 nights in a row, and discovers that one of their castaways, Ethan Rom, is not on the passenger manifest. Ethan kidnaps the pregnant Claire and Charlie, and attempts to hang Charlie after being chased by survivors, but he's rescued by Jack and Kate. Two weeks later, Locke finds Claire stumbling through the jungle, completely distraught with amnesia. This starts many confrontations between the survivors and the Others, which, in turn, leads to the death of one other survivor and Ethan himself, whom Charlie kills for revenge.
There are fleeting confrontations with polar bears, the Monster and Danielle Rousseau. Violence is sporadic, but the survivors' close-knit society is held together due to the de facto leader Jack, the level-headed Kate, Sayid and Hurley, along with distant hunter Locke, who appears to have some supporters among the survivors despite disagreements with Jack, such as the young couple Charlie and Claire, and Boone. However, Locke begins to converse with Walt and teaches him to throw knives, angering his protective father Michael. Sun eventually reveals she speaks English, causing a momentary lapse of trust in her husband, Jin.
After two weeks, Locke and Boone discover a mysterious hatch on the ground with no handle, and Locke become obsessed about what may be inside. Under the guise of unsuccessful boar hunting, they spend many days covertly pondering and excavating it. While exploring the island, Locke and Boone also discover a Beechcraft lodged on the side of a cliff. Boone climbs up the cliff into the plane. Inside, he finds a radio and sends a distress call. A male voice answers, "Is someone out there?" to which Boone responds, "We are the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815." The voice replies, "We're the survivors of 815." The Beechcraft then falls from the cliff and badly injures Boone. Locke takes Boone back to the camp, but Jack is unable to save his life. At the same time, Claire goes into labor and Kate delivers the baby.
Michael decides to build a raft to escape with his son Walt, and they are joined by Sawyer and Jin. In the first night after launching, they are surprised and initially delighted to encounter another boat, but it turns out to carry a group of the Others who demand that Walt be handed over to them. In the ensuing chaos, the raft is destroyed, Sawyer is shot, and Walt is kidnapped.
Rousseau leads a party of survivors to the Black Rock, a wooden ship in the middle of the island, containing a cache of dynamite which can be used to open the hatch. Along the way, one of them is chased by The Monster, manifested as a black cloud, which Rousseau calls the island's "security system." Jack and Locke bring the dynamite back to the hatch, and use it to force open the hatch door to look inside. The season ends with them looking down into the darkness of the shaft below.
    </p>
    <h2 id="season2">Season 2</h2>
<p>
      After having opened the Hatch at the end of Season 1, it is revealed to be a research station, which has running water and electricity, is well stocked with food, and has a 1970s era computer, which, according to its previous occupant, Desmond, must have the Numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 typed into it every 108 minutes, or "the world will end." The computer was broken during the first foray into the Swan station, and Desmond flees, expecting impending doom. Sayid, however, was able to fix the computer.
The survivors debate whether or not to trust Desmond's instructions, but set up shifts to keep watch and enter the numbers, having repaired the computer. They gradually learn through bits of filmstrip that what they had previously referred to as "the Hatch" is actually the "Swan station", one of several different DHARMA Initiative stations present on the Island. Shannon, while searching for Vincent the night the Hatch is opened, stumbles upon Walt, who, soaking wet and speaking backwards, appears and disappears right before her very eyes. Shannon believes something happened to the rafters, and her suspicions are confirmed when Claire and Shannon find the bottle of messages the rafters took with them to give to the mainland, washed up on the beach.
Sawyer and Michael create a makeshift raft from floating wreckage after the attack on their raft, the disappearance of Jin, and abduction of Walt. The currents push them back to the Island, where they encounter a panicked Jin, and then the tail section survivors, who are led by Ana Lucia, and include Libby and Mr. Eko. Ana Lucia initially directs that they be held captive, but they eventually reconcile, and head to the other side of the Island to reunite with the rest of the survivors. Meanwhile, Shannon receives yet another visit from Walt and realizes that something has happened to him and insists to Sayid that he needs her help. Shannon and Vincent go through the jungle to find Walt. Sayid tracks her down and tries to stop her. She breaks down and tells him that he's going to abandon her, just like everyone else in her life. After they admit their love for each other and reconcile, Shannon sees Walt once again in the jungle, talking backwards. She runs after him. A startled Ana Lucia mistakes Shannon for one of The Others. She fires a shot and kills Shannon. The experience of the tail section survivors on the Island is explored, and it is revealed that The Others kidnapped a total of 12 members of their group, which had been infiltrated by Goodwin. The two communities merge under awkward circumstances as Sayid is heartbroken that Shannon has died. Ana Lucia, who feels guilty about Shannon's death, feels uncomfortable among the group and like an outcast. She eventually befriends Jack and gains the acceptance of Sayid, who finally admits that Shannon's death was not of her fault, but he instead blames The Others.
Claire wrestles with the decision of whether or not to trust Charlie, who at one point suffers delusions that he has to protect the baby, but ends up endangering the child. There is some doubt on whether he is using the drugs found at the Beechcraft, however he eventually keeps his distance. Charlie takes Eko to the plane, and he grieves over the death of his brother, who was on the very same plane. This inspires Eko to have faith in the island and what it has in store for him, and he begins building a church on the island to repay his debt to Yemi.
The Others become a more visible presence in this season. One prominent Other, Tom (the man from the raft who took Walt), tells the survivors, "This is not your island, this is our island, and the only reason you're living on it is because we let you live on it." Later, when the baby falls ill, Claire explores the Staff for medicine, another DHARMA station, and it is revealed that Tom's beard is fake; the Others may be lying about their true nature.
Rousseau captures a man who identifies himself as "Henry Gale, from Minnesota", another castaway on the Island who had crashed there by balloon. The survivors doubt his story, particularly Sayid, who holds him captive in The Swan and brutally interrogates him as he places the blame on them for Shannon's death.
Locke, who became trapped in the living area of the Swan during a strange "lockdown" procedure before he could enter the number codes, asks Henry Gale to enter them by crawling through the air vents. As the countdown reaches zero, a map appears on a blast door, detailing an arrangement of stations on the Island. Later, Gale claims to have never entered the code as everything returned to normal. When faced, however, with proof of his deception (the ID of the real Henry Gale), "Gale" admits that he is indeed one of "The Others". The event, however, tarnishes Locke's faith in the whole system, and in the Island itself.
Following dreams and the blast door map, Eko and Locke discover the central "?" (Pearl) station, which appears to be a station designed to observe the occupants of the other stations. Due to this observation of the Swan station, Locke believes that entering the Numbers is merely a psychological experiment. This puts Locke into a crisis of faith, but seems to make Eko even more sure of what he must do (entering the numbers).
Michael continues to seek his kidnapped son, Walt. After having communicated with him on the Swan's computer, he leaves the survivors to chase after his son, but is captured. Arriving at a collection of huts that seem to be the Others' camp, he is allowed to spend three minutes with his son. The Others let Michael go, promising him Walt back, if he frees Henry, and brings Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley back to their camp. He returns to The Swan, kills Ana Lucia and Libby, frees Henry, and shoots himself in the shoulder, making it appear that Henry committed the murders and escaped. During the two survivors' memorial, Desmond returns to the Island in his sailboat.
Michael convinces Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley to join him in a raid against "The Others" to rescue Walt, but Sayid believes that Michael is leading the four into a trap. His plan is to use Desmond's sailboat to approach The Others' camp by water. He enlists the aid of Jin, who knows how to sail, and Sun, to translate. (Sun, earlier in the season, is revealed to be pregnant, even though Jin is infertile).
Despite Jack's foreknowledge of Michael's plans, The Others ambush and capture them. Henry, who turns out to be The Others' leader, fulfills the deal, freeing Michael and Walt and giving them a boat. Hurley is freed and instructed to go back to his camp to tell the other survivors that they may never go back there.
In the meantime, Sayid, Sun and Jin, arrive at The Others' camp, which has been abandoned. They start a signal fire, and wait for Jack and his party to rendezvous with them.
Locke and Desmond take over the The Swan station from Eko and prevent him from entering the Numbers at the appointed time. Both of them argue over the validity of the threat until the last minute when Desmond realizes the last time the code was not put through was the day of the plane crash, explaining that the magnetism from the station was the cause of the crash. When the timer reaches zero, a great magnetic field erupts. Desmond goes to the system termination station under the floor, which he activates by turning the key. The immediate result is not shown, but the entire island is enveloped by a white-violet light and a shrill humming sound.
The season ends with a scene of a cramped polar research station where two men excitedly notice what appears to be the anomaly, and they proceed to phone Desmond's old fiancÃ©e, Penelope, to tell her that they have "found it".

<h2 id="season3">Season 3</h2>
<p>
      After the events at the Pala Ferry, Season 3 picks up with Jack, Kate and Sawyer being held prisoner by the Others on another Island. The Others as a group are revealed to be less omnipotent as first thought, wearing normal clothes and having many resources on the island, including electricity, running water and a large supply of food and weapons. Jack is held in an aquarium where he meets Juliet, an Other. Sawyer, in a cage, meets Karl in the cage opposite; but soon, Karl is moved elsewhere and replaced with Kate. She and Sawyer are forced to do hard labor with the rest of The Others. Ben promises Jack safe passage off the island if he complies to do what they need him to do.
Sayid, Sun and Jin begin to worry when Jack and his group aren't contacting them, so Sayid sets a trap. However, The Others board the Elizabeth using the submarine and steal it on Ben's orders, but not without a casualty. Sun fatally wounds Colleen, who is shipped back. Jack is forced to operate on her but is unable to save her, to the distress of her husband. Pickett beats Sawyer, and Kate confesses that she loves him.
After the Hatch implodes, Desmond is sent back into 1996 with Penny in London. Dismissing the recent events as a broken memory, he continues on with his life, failing to secure a job at Widmore Industries and earn Charles Widmore's respect. Desmond sees Charlie on the street, and his memories of the future return, causing him to seek help, to no avail; he instead comes across Ms. Hawking, who seems to have knowledge of future events and tells him about the universe's way of "course-correcting". Desmond breaks up with Penny, realizing there's no way to run away from his destiny to crash on the island, and suffers a blow to the head which causes him to be sent back to the present (on the island).
Desmond meets Hurley, who realizes he can see flashes of future events. Locke wakes up mute, returns to camp and has a vision of the late Boone who leads him through a surreal airport, eventually telling him he needs to save Eko. Along with Charlie, they rescue a severely injured Eko from a polar bear in its cave. When they return, the news has spread of Jack, Kate and Sawyer's capture by The Others and Michael's betrayal; the camp is in uproar particularly Nikki and Paulo. Locke vows to save their friends, but they must first wait for Sayid to return with the boat.
Jack soon discovers that he's there to operate on Ben's spinal tumor and Juliet surreptitiously asks him to kill Ben during the surgery, bringing their power struggle to Jack's attention. Back at the beach camp, when Sayid, Sun and Jin return without the boat, Locke plans to contact the Others via the computer in the Pearl so they can rescue their captives. Eko's condition worsens, and he crawls away in the night towards the Beechcraft. Locke and Sayid lead a group to the Pearl, track and find Eko there, and see a glimpse of one of the Others on the TV screen. Eko becomes the Monster's second victim, and they bury him in the jungle. Locke sees a hidden message on Eko's stick telling him to head north.
Alex warns Kate that Pickett plans to kill Sawyer, to avenge his wife's death. Juliet, on Ben's orders, brings Kate to plead with Jack to do the surgery, however he does not comply, thinking Kate has been "turned" by them by using Sawyer's life as leverage. Kate and Sawyer consummate their relationship in the cage, thinking it's Sawyer's last day alive. Jack sees them and grows jealous, and finally agrees to do the surgery, where he holds Ben's life ransom for Kate and Sawyer's freedom. The two fight for freedom, and run from Pickett, but they come across Alex who bargains with them - they rescue Karl from brainwashing - in return for a boat. Ben asks Juliet to help Kate and Sawyer escape in return for safe passage off of the island and also so Jack will stitch his bleeding kidney. Juliet kills Pickett, who was about to kill Sawyer. Kate, Sawyer and Karl sail to the main island. Juliet is then incarcerated for killing one of their own, but Jack bargains with Ben to commute her sentence of execution. The Others, with Jack in tow, head for the Barracks on the main island.
Kate and Sawyer return to the beach, but the latter stays behind while Kate, Sayid and Locke seek Rousseau's help in the jungle. The four leave and head north to rescue the still-captive Jack. Desmond tells Charlie the grave news that he's going to die after seeing him struck by lightning and drowning while saving Claire. In an effort to cheer Charlie up, Hurley fixes a newly found DHARMA Van and they take a joyride. Later, Claire concocts an impressive plan of capturing a seabird and attaching a rescue message. Later, two survivors are found apparently dead, but they are really paralyzed and ultimately buried alive. In response to this, Hurley cons Sawyer into leadership to calm the survivors after the recent traumatic events.
While heading northwards, Kate, Sayid, Locke and Rousseau discover the Flame and its inhabitant, who claims to be the last surviving member of the DHARMA Initiative. Sayid discovers otherwise and they find Bea Klugh hiding in the basement - both of them members of the Others. Mikhail kills Bea to avoid betraying their secrets, and the castaways take Mikhail prisoner. A day later, they come across the sonar fence, and Locke pushes Mikhail within its range to protect his secret of being paralyzed. They scale the fence using a branch and infiltrate the Barracks, however Jack has already made his decision to leave the island. Kate and Sayid are held prisoner, however Locke sneaks into Ben's house and is manipulated into destroying the submarine, which Jack and Juliet were going to use to leave the island. Ben then takes Locke to see his father, whom they've also taken hostage.
The Others vacate the Barracks, while Locke joins them. Kate then wakes in the jungle handcuffed to Juliet, and they make their way back to the Barracks while being chased and scanned by the Monster. Juliet reveals her deception to Kate by showing her the key, in an effort to win her trust. They reunite with Jack and Sayid, and then head back to the beach. The survivors are initially very distrustful of Juliet, but when Claire falls dangerously ill, Juliet reveals that she's got the medical skills to save her, and after picking up the tools, she does so. Jack's trust of Juliet creates a rift between him and the rest of the survivors at first, but for now they trust his judgment. However, when Juliet takes the pregnant Sun to the Staff to give her an ultrasound, it appears she is working as a mole for Ben, though her true feelings may lie with the survivors. Juliet eventually tells Jack about Ben's plan in private, and the fact that Sun will die in two months if she doesn't leave the island, and they begin to create a plan to combat the Others once and for all.
Desmond sees a flash of someone parachuting onto the island, leading Charlie, Hurley and Jin towards the visitor. Desmond believes it's Penny here to rescue them, and is initially willing to let Charlie die in hopes of reuniting with his ex-fiancee. Instead, as Desmond lets Charlie live, Naomi appears, not Penny. Mikhail, seemingly alive, stumbles upon the group and in return for his freedom, he stitches the injured parachutist. When Naomi wakes, she tells Hurley that the wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 has already been found with no survivors. When they return to camp, they hide Naomi from Jack and Juliet because they don't trust them, and at first bring only Sayid in to question her. Naomi claims to have been hired by Penny Widmore to find Desmond and consequently rescue him. Eventually, the survivors hold a meeting in the evening when Jack and Juliet go missing to discuss the recent developments, as a freighter is anchored 80 miles offshore which holds potential rescue.
The Others reach the Ruins, where Locke's father is held prisoner. Ben tells Locke of his plan to kidnap the pregnant women from the survivors camp. Locke steals Juliet's Dictaphone tape, and Ben ridicules him in front of the rest of the Others by revealing he is unable to kill his father, showing he isn't ready to make a full commitment to their group. However, Richard, another "Other", provides Locke with a candidate who might commit the deed - Sawyer. After the Others break camp, Locke returns to camp and secretly leads Sawyer away, telling him Ben is captive in the Black Rock. Instead, he meets Anthony Cooper and realizes he is the man who destroyed his life, and consequently quenches his thirst for revenge by killing him as predicted by Richard. Locke gives Sawyer the tape and he heads back to the beach. Locke, however, returns to the Others and demands to see Jacob. Ben, initially doubtful, eventually complies even to the disagreement of the rest of the Others. In spite of the return of Mikhail, who brings information on Naomi, who could pose a threat, Ben leads Locke to see his leader, and the latter - whom only Ben can see - pleads Locke for help. Enraged with jealousy, Ben shoots Locke and leaves him for dead at the Mass Grave.
Sawyer returns to the beach with Juliet's tape as proof that she's a mole. Naomi is revealed to the rest of the survivors and they discuss the situation. Jack and Juliet return, claiming that Juliet has turned against the Others and is willing to help. In the morning, Jack leads a selection of the survivors to Danielle and here he explains his plan to combat the Others with dynamite. The survivors load the tents with dynamite, but Karl returns from the other side of the island with a message from Alex that Ben has decided to move up the raid. Jack leads the survivors to safety at the radio tower, as Charlie swims down to the Looking Glass to turn off the blocking signal so Naomi's satellite phone can call the freighter, willingly going to his death.
Sayid, Jin and Bernard stay behind to blow up the tents, but are captured by Tom and Ryan. Bonnie radios Ben and Richard about Charlie's arrival and Juliet's betrayal, so he sends Mikhail to sort them out. Ben realizes Alex has also betrayed them due to the survivors' knowledge of the raid coming early, and he decides to intercept Jack to tell him of the impending threat from the freighter. Jack doesn't believe him, so Ben demands they hand over the phone; since he doesn't comply, Ben radios Tom to execute Sayid, Jin and Bernard, and he seemingly shoots the three of them. Jack beats Ben and takes him prisoner, and Alex is reunited with her mother after 16 years. Locke, about to commit suicide in the mass grave, sees an apparition of Walt, telling him Naomi and the freighter are here to kill them all.
Mikhail, following orders, kills Greta and Bonnie, however is shot himself by Desmond. Sawyer, Juliet and Hurley head back to the beach to help the shooters, and they discover that they are alive. Tom believes Ben has lost his mind for keeping them alive. They fight the remaining Others and rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Inside the Looking Glass, Charlie gains the code to the jamming equipment from Bonnie before she dies and disables it. However, he talks to Penny for a fleeting moment, but Mikhail detonates a grenade in the water and the room begins to flood. Charlie writes on his hand "Not Penny's Boat" in order to show Desmond that Naomi was lying after all, before drowning. Jack and the survivors reach the radio tower and Naomi calls for help. Locke appears and throws a knife in her back, threatens and warns Jack that calling the freighter is going to cause disastrous results, however he doesn't believe him. Jack calls the freighter anyway and Minkowski tells him they're on their way. The survivors celebrate, with rescue seemingly at hand.
