  <h2 id="season1">Season 1</h2>
    <p>
      On September 22, 2004, a plane breaks apart in mid-air, scattering survivors on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific. Forty-eight of these survivors, after the initial shock passes, attempt to set up a camp and figure out where they are but are disturbed by loud roaring noises and crashing trees emanating from the nearby jungle.
Three of the survivors, Jack, Kate, and Charlie, set out to find the plane's cockpit. An injured pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after takeoff, turned back for Fiji, and hit turbulence. The plane was a thousand miles off course when it crashed. The Monster rips the pilot from the cockpit, consequently killing him, and the remaining three run for the beach.
Jack, a spinal surgeon from Los Angeles, discovers a mugshot of Kate, with whom he has begun a close friendship. After initial mistrust and the death of the Marshal, whom he tries to save, both of them agree to start afresh.
One of the survivors, a former Iraqi Republican Guard communications officer named Sayid, attempts to repair the transceiver from the plane. A few survivors (Sayid, Boone, Shannon, Charlie, Kate, and Sawyer) trek high into the mountains in an attempt to get a signal and are attacked by a polar bear along the way. When they finally do turn on the transceiver, they learn that its signal is being blocked by a transmission of a woman's voice speaking in French, which Shannon translates as: "I'm alone now, on the island alone. Please someone come. The others are dead. It killed them. It killed them all." The message repeats with an automated count implying, according to Sayid's calculation, that it has been repeating for over sixteen years and five months. Coupled with the pilot's last words, the survivors' hopes of rescue are dampened; and despite the group trying to keep the discovery undercover, the news spreads through the camp throughout the first few days.
When food supplies run low, Locke leads the first hunting party for boar. As Kate's resourcefulness comes in handy, Michael and Walt, father and son, struggle to get along. On the sixth day, a woman drowns, and a young man named Boone tries to prove his worth. Jack goes on a spiritual quest when he begins to see visions of his deceased father on the island, and begins a science versus faith conflict with Locke. Eventually, the group of survivors split in half, whilst a few moved inland to a cluster of caves with fresh water and protection. Others stayed at the beach in hopes of rescue, and they moved once again when the tide began to carry the wreckage of the plane into the sea. Jack becomes the de facto leader. Intense rivalries emerge when disagreements on allocation of supplies becomes an issue, especially between Jack, Sayid and Sawyer. As conflict comes to head, Sawyer is tortured and then accidentally stabbed in the arm by Sayid, who then leaves the camp in shame for hurting Sawyer.He begins a journey of walking down the beach alone, telling Jack not to come after him.
Sayid finds a cable running out of the ocean and into the jungle. When he follows it, he encounters Danielle Rousseau, the French-speaking woman from the repeating transmission. She tells Sayid how she came to be on the Island, and implies she killed those she arrived with. Sayid eventually escapes with some of her papers, with potential knowledge of a group of hostile individuals, The Others, on the Island, who kidnapped Rousseau's baby daughter. Over the course of the season, Rousseau has other intermittent contact with the survivors.
Trying his best to make life on the island as comfortable as possible, Hurley conducts a census of the survivors when Claire is seemingly attacked 2 nights in a row, and discovers that one of their castaways, Ethan Rom, is not on the passenger manifest. Ethan kidnaps the pregnant Claire and Charlie, and attempts to hang Charlie after being chased by survivors, but he's rescued by Jack and Kate. Two weeks later, Locke finds Claire stumbling through the jungle, completely distraught with amnesia. This starts many confrontations between the survivors and the Others, which, in turn, leads to the death of one other survivor and Ethan himself, whom Charlie kills for revenge.
There are fleeting confrontations with polar bears, the Monster and Danielle Rousseau. Violence is sporadic, but the survivors' close-knit society is held together due to the de facto leader Jack, the level-headed Kate, Sayid and Hurley, along with distant hunter Locke, who appears to have some supporters among the survivors despite disagreements with Jack, such as the young couple Charlie and Claire, and Boone. However, Locke begins to converse with Walt and teaches him to throw knives, angering his protective father Michael. Sun eventually reveals she speaks English, causing a momentary lapse of trust in her husband, Jin.
After two weeks, Locke and Boone discover a mysterious hatch on the ground with no handle, and Locke become obsessed about what may be inside. Under the guise of unsuccessful boar hunting, they spend many days covertly pondering and excavating it. While exploring the island, Locke and Boone also discover a Beechcraft lodged on the side of a cliff. Boone climbs up the cliff into the plane. Inside, he finds a radio and sends a distress call. A male voice answers, "Is someone out there?" to which Boone responds, "We are the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815." The voice replies, "We're the survivors of 815." The Beechcraft then falls from the cliff and badly injures Boone. Locke takes Boone back to the camp, but Jack is unable to save his life. At the same time, Claire goes into labor and Kate delivers the baby.
Michael decides to build a raft to escape with his son Walt, and they are joined by Sawyer and Jin. In the first night after launching, they are surprised and initially delighted to encounter another boat, but it turns out to carry a group of the Others who demand that Walt be handed over to them. In the ensuing chaos, the raft is destroyed, Sawyer is shot, and Walt is kidnapped.
Rousseau leads a party of survivors to the Black Rock, a wooden ship in the middle of the island, containing a cache of dynamite which can be used to open the hatch. Along the way, one of them is chased by The Monster, manifested as a black cloud, which Rousseau calls the island's "security system." Jack and Locke bring the dynamite back to the hatch, and use it to force open the hatch door to look inside. The season ends with them looking down into the darkness of the shaft below.

    </p>
    

<h2 id="season2">Season 2</h2>
<p>
      After having opened the Hatch at the end of Season 1, it is revealed to be a research station, which has running water and electricity, is well stocked with food, and has a 1970s era computer, which, according to its previous occupant, Desmond, must have the Numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 typed into it every 108 minutes, or "the world will end." The computer was broken during the first foray into the Swan station, and Desmond flees, expecting impending doom. Sayid, however, was able to fix the computer.
The survivors debate whether or not to trust Desmond's instructions, but set up shifts to keep watch and enter the numbers, having repaired the computer. They gradually learn through bits of filmstrip that what they had previously referred to as "the Hatch" is actually the "Swan station", one of several different DHARMA Initiative stations present on the Island. Shannon, while searching for Vincent the night the Hatch is opened, stumbles upon Walt, who, soaking wet and speaking backwards, appears and disappears right before her very eyes. Shannon believes something happened to the rafters, and her suspicions are confirmed when Claire and Shannon find the bottle of messages the rafters took with them to give to the mainland, washed up on the beach.
Sawyer and Michael create a makeshift raft from floating wreckage after the attack on their raft, the disappearance of Jin, and abduction of Walt. The currents push them back to the Island, where they encounter a panicked Jin, and then the tail section survivors, who are led by Ana Lucia, and include Libby and Mr. Eko. Ana Lucia initially directs that they be held captive, but they eventually reconcile, and head to the other side of the Island to reunite with the rest of the survivors. Meanwhile, Shannon receives yet another visit from Walt and realizes that something has happened to him and insists to Sayid that he needs her help. Shannon and Vincent go through the jungle to find Walt. Sayid tracks her down and tries to stop her. She breaks down and tells him that he's going to abandon her, just like everyone else in her life. After they admit their love for each other and reconcile, Shannon sees Walt once again in the jungle, talking backwards. She runs after him. A startled Ana Lucia mistakes Shannon for one of The Others. She fires a shot and kills Shannon. The experience of the tail section survivors on the Island is explored, and it is revealed that The Others kidnapped a total of 12 members of their group, which had been infiltrated by Goodwin. The two communities merge under awkward circumstances as Sayid is heartbroken that Shannon has died. Ana Lucia, who feels guilty about Shannon's death, feels uncomfortable among the group and like an outcast. She eventually befriends Jack and gains the acceptance of Sayid, who finally admits that Shannon's death was not of her fault, but he instead blames The Others.
Claire wrestles with the decision of whether or not to trust Charlie, who at one point suffers delusions that he has to protect the baby, but ends up endangering the child. There is some doubt on whether he is using the drugs found at the Beechcraft, however he eventually keeps his distance. Charlie takes Eko to the plane, and he grieves over the death of his brother, who was on the very same plane. This inspires Eko to have faith in the island and what it has in store for him, and he begins building a church on the island to repay his debt to Yemi.
The Others become a more visible presence in this season. One prominent Other, Tom (the man from the raft who took Walt), tells the survivors, "This is not your island, this is our island, and the only reason you're living on it is because we let you live on it." Later, when the baby falls ill, Claire explores the Staff for medicine, another DHARMA station, and it is revealed that Tom's beard is fake; the Others may be lying about their true nature.
Rousseau captures a man who identifies himself as "Henry Gale, from Minnesota", another castaway on the Island who had crashed there by balloon. The survivors doubt his story, particularly Sayid, who holds him captive in The Swan and brutally interrogates him as he places the blame on them for Shannon's death.
Locke, who became trapped in the living area of the Swan during a strange "lockdown" procedure before he could enter the number codes, asks Henry Gale to enter them by crawling through the air vents. As the countdown reaches zero, a map appears on a blast door, detailing an arrangement of stations on the Island. Later, Gale claims to have never entered the code as everything returned to normal. When faced, however, with proof of his deception (the ID of the real Henry Gale), "Gale" admits that he is indeed one of "The Others". The event, however, tarnishes Locke's faith in the whole system, and in the Island itself.
Following dreams and the blast door map, Eko and Locke discover the central "?" (Pearl) station, which appears to be a station designed to observe the occupants of the other stations. Due to this observation of the Swan station, Locke believes that entering the Numbers is merely a psychological experiment. This puts Locke into a crisis of faith, but seems to make Eko even more sure of what he must do (entering the numbers).
Michael continues to seek his kidnapped son, Walt. After having communicated with him on the Swan's computer, he leaves the survivors to chase after his son, but is captured. Arriving at a collection of huts that seem to be the Others' camp, he is allowed to spend three minutes with his son. The Others let Michael go, promising him Walt back, if he frees Henry, and brings Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley back to their camp. He returns to The Swan, kills Ana Lucia and Libby, frees Henry, and shoots himself in the shoulder, making it appear that Henry committed the murders and escaped. During the two survivors' memorial, Desmond returns to the Island in his sailboat.
Michael convinces Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley to join him in a raid against "The Others" to rescue Walt, but Sayid believes that Michael is leading the four into a trap. His plan is to use Desmond's sailboat to approach The Others' camp by water. He enlists the aid of Jin, who knows how to sail, and Sun, to translate. (Sun, earlier in the season, is revealed to be pregnant, even though Jin is infertile).
Despite Jack's foreknowledge of Michael's plans, The Others ambush and capture them. Henry, who turns out to be The Others' leader, fulfills the deal, freeing Michael and Walt and giving them a boat. Hurley is freed and instructed to go back to his camp to tell the other survivors that they may never go back there.
In the meantime, Sayid, Sun and Jin, arrive at The Others' camp, which has been abandoned. They start a signal fire, and wait for Jack and his party to rendezvous with them.
Locke and Desmond take over the The Swan station from Eko and prevent him from entering the Numbers at the appointed time. Both of them argue over the validity of the threat until the last minute when Desmond realizes the last time the code was not put through was the day of the plane crash, explaining that the magnetism from the station was the cause of the crash. When the timer reaches zero, a great magnetic field erupts. Desmond goes to the system termination station under the floor, which he activates by turning the key. The immediate result is not shown, but the entire island is enveloped by a white-violet light and a shrill humming sound.
The season ends with a scene of a cramped polar research station where two men excitedly notice what appears to be the anomaly, and they proceed to phone Desmond's old fiancée, Penelope, to tell her that they have "found it".

<h2 id="season3">Season 3</h2>
<p>
      After the events at the Pala Ferry, Season 3 picks up with Jack, Kate and Sawyer being held prisoner by the Others on another Island. The Others as a group are revealed to be less omnipotent as first thought, wearing normal clothes and having many resources on the island, including electricity, running water and a large supply of food and weapons. Jack is held in an aquarium where he meets Juliet, an Other. Sawyer, in a cage, meets Karl in the cage opposite; but soon, Karl is moved elsewhere and replaced with Kate. She and Sawyer are forced to do hard labor with the rest of The Others. Ben promises Jack safe passage off the island if he complies to do what they need him to do.
Sayid, Sun and Jin begin to worry when Jack and his group aren't contacting them, so Sayid sets a trap. However, The Others board the Elizabeth using the submarine and steal it on Ben's orders, but not without a casualty. Sun fatally wounds Colleen, who is shipped back. Jack is forced to operate on her but is unable to save her, to the distress of her husband. Pickett beats Sawyer, and Kate confesses that she loves him.
After the Hatch implodes, Desmond is sent back into 1996 with Penny in London. Dismissing the recent events as a broken memory, he continues on with his life, failing to secure a job at Widmore Industries and earn Charles Widmore's respect. Desmond sees Charlie on the street, and his memories of the future return, causing him to seek help, to no avail; he instead comes across Ms. Hawking, who seems to have knowledge of future events and tells him about the universe's way of "course-correcting". Desmond breaks up with Penny, realizing there's no way to run away from his destiny to crash on the island, and suffers a blow to the head which causes him to be sent back to the present (on the island).
Desmond meets Hurley, who realizes he can see flashes of future events. Locke wakes up mute, returns to camp and has a vision of the late Boone who leads him through a surreal airport, eventually telling him he needs to save Eko. Along with Charlie, they rescue a severely injured Eko from a polar bear in its cave. When they return, the news has spread of Jack, Kate and Sawyer's capture by The Others and Michael's betrayal; the camp is in uproar particularly Nikki and Paulo. Locke vows to save their friends, but they must first wait for Sayid to return with the boat.
Jack soon discovers that he's there to operate on Ben's spinal tumor and Juliet surreptitiously asks him to kill Ben during the surgery, bringing their power struggle to Jack's attention. Back at the beach camp, when Sayid, Sun and Jin return without the boat, Locke plans to contact the Others via the computer in the Pearl so they can rescue their captives. Eko's condition worsens, and he crawls away in the night towards the Beechcraft. Locke and Sayid lead a group to the Pearl, track and find Eko there, and see a glimpse of one of the Others on the TV screen. Eko becomes the Monster's second victim, and they bury him in the jungle. Locke sees a hidden message on Eko's stick telling him to head north.
Alex warns Kate that Pickett plans to kill Sawyer, to avenge his wife's death. Juliet, on Ben's orders, brings Kate to plead with Jack to do the surgery, however he does not comply, thinking Kate has been "turned" by them by using Sawyer's life as leverage. Kate and Sawyer consummate their relationship in the cage, thinking it's Sawyer's last day alive. Jack sees them and grows jealous, and finally agrees to do the surgery, where he holds Ben's life ransom for Kate and Sawyer's freedom. The two fight for freedom, and run from Pickett, but they come across Alex who bargains with them - they rescue Karl from brainwashing - in return for a boat. Ben asks Juliet to help Kate and Sawyer escape in return for safe passage off of the island and also so Jack will stitch his bleeding kidney. Juliet kills Pickett, who was about to kill Sawyer. Kate, Sawyer and Karl sail to the main island. Juliet is then incarcerated for killing one of their own, but Jack bargains with Ben to commute her sentence of execution. The Others, with Jack in tow, head for the Barracks on the main island.
Kate and Sawyer return to the beach, but the latter stays behind while Kate, Sayid and Locke seek Rousseau's help in the jungle. The four leave and head north to rescue the still-captive Jack. Desmond tells Charlie the grave news that he's going to die after seeing him struck by lightning and drowning while saving Claire. In an effort to cheer Charlie up, Hurley fixes a newly found DHARMA Van and they take a joyride. Later, Claire concocts an impressive plan of capturing a seabird and attaching a rescue message. Later, two survivors are found apparently dead, but they are really paralyzed and ultimately buried alive. In response to this, Hurley cons Sawyer into leadership to calm the survivors after the recent traumatic events.
While heading northwards, Kate, Sayid, Locke and Rousseau discover the Flame and its inhabitant, who claims to be the last surviving member of the DHARMA Initiative. Sayid discovers otherwise and they find Bea Klugh hiding in the basement - both of them members of the Others. Mikhail kills Bea to avoid betraying their secrets, and the castaways take Mikhail prisoner. A day later, they come across the sonar fence, and Locke pushes Mikhail within its range to protect his secret of being paralyzed. They scale the fence using a branch and infiltrate the Barracks, however Jack has already made his decision to leave the island. Kate and Sayid are held prisoner, however Locke sneaks into Ben's house and is manipulated into destroying the submarine, which Jack and Juliet were going to use to leave the island. Ben then takes Locke to see his father, whom they've also taken hostage.
The Others vacate the Barracks, while Locke joins them. Kate then wakes in the jungle handcuffed to Juliet, and they make their way back to the Barracks while being chased and scanned by the Monster. Juliet reveals her deception to Kate by showing her the key, in an effort to win her trust. They reunite with Jack and Sayid, and then head back to the beach. The survivors are initially very distrustful of Juliet, but when Claire falls dangerously ill, Juliet reveals that she's got the medical skills to save her, and after picking up the tools, she does so. Jack's trust of Juliet creates a rift between him and the rest of the survivors at first, but for now they trust his judgment. However, when Juliet takes the pregnant Sun to the Staff to give her an ultrasound, it appears she is working as a mole for Ben, though her true feelings may lie with the survivors. Juliet eventually tells Jack about Ben's plan in private, and the fact that Sun will die in two months if she doesn't leave the island, and they begin to create a plan to combat the Others once and for all.
Desmond sees a flash of someone parachuting onto the island, leading Charlie, Hurley and Jin towards the visitor. Desmond believes it's Penny here to rescue them, and is initially willing to let Charlie die in hopes of reuniting with his ex-fiancee. Instead, as Desmond lets Charlie live, Naomi appears, not Penny. Mikhail, seemingly alive, stumbles upon the group and in return for his freedom, he stitches the injured parachutist. When Naomi wakes, she tells Hurley that the wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 has already been found with no survivors. When they return to camp, they hide Naomi from Jack and Juliet because they don't trust them, and at first bring only Sayid in to question her. Naomi claims to have been hired by Penny Widmore to find Desmond and consequently rescue him. Eventually, the survivors hold a meeting in the evening when Jack and Juliet go missing to discuss the recent developments, as a freighter is anchored 80 miles offshore which holds potential rescue.
The Others reach the Ruins, where Locke's father is held prisoner. Ben tells Locke of his plan to kidnap the pregnant women from the survivors camp. Locke steals Juliet's Dictaphone tape, and Ben ridicules him in front of the rest of the Others by revealing he is unable to kill his father, showing he isn't ready to make a full commitment to their group. However, Richard, another "Other", provides Locke with a candidate who might commit the deed - Sawyer. After the Others break camp, Locke returns to camp and secretly leads Sawyer away, telling him Ben is captive in the Black Rock. Instead, he meets Anthony Cooper and realizes he is the man who destroyed his life, and consequently quenches his thirst for revenge by killing him as predicted by Richard. Locke gives Sawyer the tape and he heads back to the beach. Locke, however, returns to the Others and demands to see Jacob. Ben, initially doubtful, eventually complies even to the disagreement of the rest of the Others. In spite of the return of Mikhail, who brings information on Naomi, who could pose a threat, Ben leads Locke to see his leader, and the latter - whom only Ben can see - pleads Locke for help. Enraged with jealousy, Ben shoots Locke and leaves him for dead at the Mass Grave.
Sawyer returns to the beach with Juliet's tape as proof that she's a mole. Naomi is revealed to the rest of the survivors and they discuss the situation. Jack and Juliet return, claiming that Juliet has turned against the Others and is willing to help. In the morning, Jack leads a selection of the survivors to Danielle and here he explains his plan to combat the Others with dynamite. The survivors load the tents with dynamite, but Karl returns from the other side of the island with a message from Alex that Ben has decided to move up the raid. Jack leads the survivors to safety at the radio tower, as Charlie swims down to the Looking Glass to turn off the blocking signal so Naomi's satellite phone can call the freighter, willingly going to his death.
Sayid, Jin and Bernard stay behind to blow up the tents, but are captured by Tom and Ryan. Bonnie radios Ben and Richard about Charlie's arrival and Juliet's betrayal, so he sends Mikhail to sort them out. Ben realizes Alex has also betrayed them due to the survivors' knowledge of the raid coming early, and he decides to intercept Jack to tell him of the impending threat from the freighter. Jack doesn't believe him, so Ben demands they hand over the phone; since he doesn't comply, Ben radios Tom to execute Sayid, Jin and Bernard, and he seemingly shoots the three of them. Jack beats Ben and takes him prisoner, and Alex is reunited with her mother after 16 years. Locke, about to commit suicide in the mass grave, sees an apparition of Walt, telling him Naomi and the freighter are here to kill them all.
Mikhail, following orders, kills Greta and Bonnie, however is shot himself by Desmond. Sawyer, Juliet and Hurley head back to the beach to help the shooters, and they discover that they are alive. Tom believes Ben has lost his mind for keeping them alive. They fight the remaining Others and rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Inside the Looking Glass, Charlie gains the code to the jamming equipment from Bonnie before she dies and disables it. However, he talks to Penny for a fleeting moment, but Mikhail detonates a grenade in the water and the room begins to flood. Charlie writes on his hand "Not Penny's Boat" in order to show Desmond that Naomi was lying after all, before drowning. Jack and the survivors reach the radio tower and Naomi calls for help. Locke appears and throws a knife in her back, threatens and warns Jack that calling the freighter is going to cause disastrous results, however he doesn't believe him. Jack calls the freighter anyway and Minkowski tells him they're on their way. The survivors celebrate, with rescue seemingly at hand.

    </p>

<h2 id="season4">Season 4</h2>
<p>
     After Jack calls the freighter, the wait begins for rescue. Naomi is clinging to life but eventually dies in front of Kate, who tells her that Locke is the man who threw a knife into her back. Just before she dies, she alerts the freighter in code that she was experiencing trouble. The survivors split into two factions, Jack's group head to the beach to get rescued, while Locke and his followers head inland to the Barracks to hide from the freighters, heeding Charlie's warning and Ben's accusation that they're here to kill everyone on the island.

Soon, a helicopter is seen flying overhead and a man parachutes from it, introducing himself as Daniel Faraday to Jack and Kate. Daniel is nervous, edgy and unclear. However he mentions that rescuing the survivors isn't their primary objective. The team also includes Miles, a ghost whisperer, Charlotte, an anthropologist, and Frank, who was supposed to be the pilot of Oceanic Flight 815 on the day that it crashed but was replaced for unknown reasons. After continued pressure, Miles admits that the real reason they're on the island is because they want to find Ben. It's later revealed that they were hired by Charles Widmore to find the island. Throughout the season, the survivors don't seem to know whether they're there to rescue or kill them, but it seems the science team were innocent.

Locke, much to his chagrin, is unable to find Jacob's cabin for further instructions on how to protect the island. When they reach the Barracks with Charlotte as a hostage, Kate and Sayid arrive. An exchange occurs - Charlotte for Miles. In return for this favor, Frank flies Sayid and Desmond to the freighter in the hope they can secure rescue. However, they arrive a day late due to flying on a slightly wrong bearing, but to the relief of the survivors on the beach, they arrive safely. However, Desmond's consciousness begins to time travel but with the help of Daniel he was able to secure his constant, Penny. In an effort to gain the survivors's trust and complete their objectives, Daniel and Charlotte trek to the Tempest to render the gas inert, however even though they were successful, Juliet mistook their intentions and fought with Charlotte. Locke's group settles in at the Barracks, and Sayid and Desmond continue to learn of Widmore's intentions on the freighter, but the news that the freighter isn't here to rescue the survivors begins to spread through the beach camp and some survivors begin to become unsettled, such as Sun and Jin, who have a momentary decision to move to Locke's camp for safety.

Ben knows the freighter crew is looking for him because he has a spy on the boat, which he reveals to Locke, along with the knowledge that Widmore is the one who is looking for the island. Michael, who tried to commit suicide three times after getting off the island and became estranged from Walt, was sent by Tom to the boat shortly after he and Walt returned to New York. He's given the alias "Kevin Johnson" and his mission was to infiltrate the crew and prevent anyone on the island from getting killed. To do this, he was instructed to activate a bomb to blow up the boat and kill everyone on it including himself. Despite Libby appearing in a vision warning him not to activate the bomb, he does so anyway. The bomb fails to detonate with a message that says "Not Yet".

Led by Martin Keamy, the Mercenary team from the freighter arrives on the island in the later-half of the episodes. They attack Locke's camp, killing around eight people, including Danielle, Alex and Karl. Some survivors flee for the beach while Locke, Ben and Hurley head to Jacob's cabin for instructions to save the island and everybody else on it; and Locke is instructed to move the island by Christian.

The helicopter and the mercenaries return to the island, and the survivors race towards it, as they come into contact with the Others and Keamy's strike team in a desperate effort to escape the island once and for all. Some survivors are ferried by Daniel to the freighter, but Desmond and Michael discover a bomb in the communications room, which is linked to Keamy's heart rate monitor. Sawyer initially boards the helicopter with Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid and Frank but when it needs to be lightened in weight, he passionately kisses Kate and jumps out of the chopper into the sea. When the helicopter lands on the freighter, there is a panic to get on the helicopter and only Frank, Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid, Desmond, Sun and Aaron manage to board the helicopter before the freighter explodes, due to Ben killing Keamy in revenge for the death of his daughter.

Before they can land on the island to rescue the survivors, Ben moves the island in space and time by moving the frozen wheel to avoid Widmore ever finding it and is banished from it, flying ten months into the future. The helicopter crashes in the ocean and they are rescued by Widmore's daughter, who has been trying to find the island for three years. Jack and Penny concoct a cover story to fool her father into thinking that the survivors crashed and swam to a different island near where the fake wreckage was placed - the Indonesian Ocean, specifically the island of Membata. Only the Oceanic Six: Jack, Kate, Aaron, Sayid, Hurley and Sun are then "rescued" at Sumba. Desmond, Penny and Frank then go into hiding.
After the rescue of the Oceanic Six, The US Coast Guard, along with Oceanic Airlines representative Karen Decker, pick up the Oceanic Six from Manukangga and fly them to a private military base west of Honolulu, Hawaii. There, Hurley reunites with his mother and father, Sun with her mother and father, Jack with his mother, however Sayid and Kate have no immediate family to greet them. The Oceanic Six are then interviewed at a press conference held by Decker. It is unknown how Widmore reacted to the Oceanic Six after their appearance, although it is probable he has complied with the cover story. It is also unknown how the Oceanic Six explained the fact that all 324 passengers of Oceanic Flight 815 were confirmed dead with their bodies found at the bottom of the ocean.
Having survived an extraordinary ordeal, the Oceanic Six quickly become famous worldwide. Sayid is reunited with Nadia after eight years, and they lead a happy life for eight months, where they get married. For the majority of the spring and summer of 2005, the Oceanic Six lead happy and content lives - except Sun. Distraught that she's lost her husband, she invests in her father's company using her settlement money, while looking for revenge. Jack returns to St. Sebastian Hospital in Los Angeles, Kate lives with Aaron in California, along with Hurley who lives in his parents' mansion. Many of the Oceanic Six congregate at occasions such as Hurley's surprise birthday party, and even Sayid greets his friend, with Nadia in tow. Kate, Jack and Sayid seem on good terms with Hurley's parents and Sayid's newlywed Nadia, and all of them were present for Christian's funeral except Sun, who blames Jack for Jin's apparent death, where Jack meets Carole Littleton, Claire's mother, who tells him of their connection.

This devastating news leads Jack to become distant with Kate and Aaron. Along with this, not all is as it seems, as the Numbers begin to reappear in Hurley's life. Sun gives birth to her daughter, Ji Yeon Kwon, alone in Seoul. Soon afterward, Hurley makes the effort to visit and comfort her at Jin's grave.
In October, the first tragedy since the Oceanic Six were rescued occurs in the form of the death of Nadia in Los Angeles. Four days later heralded the return of Ben, ten months late from the Island. Appearing in the Sahara, he eventually made his way to Tikrit, Iraq, and contacted Sayid at Nadia's funeral concerning her killer - Bakir, an agent of Widmore's. Consequently, Sayid is recruited in Ben's war against Widmore and the fight for the Island, in return for protecting the remaining survivors left on the Island.
The lives of the Oceanic Six continue to descend into disarray as Jack slowly turns to alcohol after learning that Claire is his half-sister. Hurley begins to see visions of Charlie, and he participates in a car chase in downtown LA after "freaking out". It is implied that this is not his first time. He is subsequently recommitted to Santa Rosa Mental Institute (where he was before the crash) by Mike Walton, Ana Lucia's copartner in the LAPD. During his first few days back, he is visited by Matthew Abaddon who questions him if they are "still alive" (it is unclear who Abaddon is referring to). Hurley also has rare visits from Jack, including one in which Jack questioned him on whether he was going to break the cover story. The late Charlie is also among his visitors, and tries to tell Hurley to go back to the Island because "they need" him, but Hurley refuses to believe he is real.

Some intermediate time after October, Sayid continues to work as an assassin for Ben, targeting a few minor people associated with Charles Widmore, including Mr. Avellino and Elsa. Ben also visits Charles Widmore in London and vows to kill his daughter in revenge for the death of his own. Sayid loses contact with the rest of the Oceanic Six, and Ben doesn't contact anyone else until late 2007.
2006 seemingly begins with Kate's pending trial, that had been put on hold in 2005, pending arraignment. Kate is charged for fraud, arson, assault on a federal officer, assault with a deadly weapon, grand larceny, grand theft auto and murder in the first-degree. During the trial, Jack testifies on Kate's behalf as a character witness and Kate's mother refuses to testify against her, eventually forgiving her for her past crimes. As a result of the star witness refusing to testify, prosecutor Melissa Dunbrook proposes a plea deal; no jail time, but Kate is not allowed to leave the state of California for ten years. Her lawyer argues against the deal, but Kate quickly accepts the terms, saying she just wants the trial to be over. Jack continues to distance himself from Aaron because of how he is related to him.

Sun's activities during 2006 and early 2007 are largely unknown and it is a mystery how much she has progressed with her new company. Meanwhile, Hurley has continued to spend time in the mental institute, and his mental state begins to deteriorate even more, as he has now "common conversations with dead people", including Mr. Eko; however Hurley's most common visitor seems to be Charlie. Kate, after her trial, begins setting Sawyer's favor straight in the real world. There are no indications what the promise made to Sawyer may be.
In late August 2007 (based on baseball series shown in newspaper), Jack changes his mind about Aaron and begins living within Kate's house in California during the summer. Jack visits Hurley, who isn't looking healthy and refuses to take his medication. Hurley relays a message from Charlie, saying "you're not supposed to raise him", adding that Jack will be getting a visitor of his own, who turns out to be his late father. Jack attempts to grab hold of something sane and proposes to Kate. She accepts, though the engagement is short-lived when two days later Jack discovers that Kate is doing something for Sawyer, causing him to become jealous. The mixture of alcohol, jealousy and visions from dead relatives causes Jack to leave the Austen household after raging at Kate: he saved her and she's not even related to Aaron. Jack descends into drug abuse, specifically of Clonazepam and later Oxycodone, mixing it with alcohol. Around this time he begins to grow a beard. After continuing to live alone, Kate has a dream where Claire tells her not to bring Aaron back to the Island.

In late 2007, the fame of the Oceanic Six seems to have faded. John Locke leaves the Island under unknown circumstances and visits separately Walt, Kate, Jack and possibly other Oceanic Six under the pseudonym Jeremy Bentham. Locke tells Jack that some terrible things happened on the Island after they left, and it was Jack's fault. Locke also tells them that they, at least Jack and Kate, need to go back to the Island. After Locke's visit, Jack becomes a broken man; however, this leads Walt to question Hurley as to why they are all lying and where his father is, as he is unaware of his death. Hurley assures him it is to keep the people who were left behind, including Walt's father, safe from Charles Widmore. At around the same time, when Ji Yeon is just over two years old, Sun visits Charles Widmore and proposes they help each other, as she claims that they have common interests.

Jack's interpersonal relationships with the rest of the Oceanic Six begins to deteriorate even more as he splits with Kate, considers Hurley insane, doesn't speak to Sun at all as she blames him for her husband's death and doesn't even know where Sayid is. Jack begins to fly on planes every weekend in the winter of 2007/early 2008 using his Oceanic Golden Pass, in an effort to return to the Island, hoping that they crash so he can try and fix the "very bad things" that have been happening. Sadly, in his New York apartment, Locke reportedly commits suicide and hangs himself in the early hours of the morning. Jack, after reading Bentham's obituary and being unable to contact Kate, becomes suicidal himself, but is interrupted by a car crash behind him. He saves the woman and child involved. Jack is visited by his very pregnant ex-wife. Later, Jack is the only attendee at Locke's viewing. He considers himself neither friend nor family of the late Jeremy Bentham. Jack can't bring himself to see Locke's body and leaves. Jack seemingly forgives Locke, believing all the things he said to him earlier that year. Jack in his broken state also begins to refer to his late father as if he was alive, thinking his visions are real, alerting a fellow doctor to his condition.
News of Locke's apparent death passes to other Oceanic Six members, including Sayid. After murdering Hurley's follower, he breaks into the mental institute in the dead of night and notifies Hurley of Locke's death two days earlier and takes him to a "safe place". Later that night, Jack calls Kate. She finally picks up the phone and they agree to meet at the airport. After dispensing with niceties, Jack tells Kate of Locke's suicide, but Kate seems defensive on the subject, wanting nothing to do with Locke. Jack tries to convince Kate it was a mistake to leave the Island, and tells her of how he tries to get back, but Kate doesn't comply and eventually loses patience at Jack's insistence that they return to the Island, and berates him for believing Locke and abandoning Aaron.
Moments after the confrontation with Kate, Jack tearfully breaks in to the Hoffs-Drawlar Funeral Parlor and finally opens Locke's casket. Ben coincidentally is visiting Locke too, and they meet for the first time in three and a half years after Ben was banished from the Island. Ben convinces Jack that all the Oceanic Six are needed for the Island to admit them back, including the body of Locke.

<h2 id="season5">Season 5</h2>
<p>
      After Ben turns the frozen wheel, a bright light envelopes the Island and it begins to move erratically through time and space obliviously to those moving with it. The Oceanic Flight 815 survivors that are left on the Island with the freighter's science team discover their camp is gone. Locke is stranded alone in the jungle while Richard and the Others disappear before his eyes. Daniel Faraday leads Sawyer, Juliet, Charlotte and Miles towards the Swan so they can figure out what time-zone they're in. On the way, Daniel explains the intricacies of time travel and introduces his theory of "Whatever Happened, Happened". Elsewhere on the Island, Locke sees the beechcraft crash and encounters a hostile Ethan who shoots him in the leg. The survivors experience their first time flash all over the Island.
Locke sits wounded and encounters Richard, who removes the bullet, gives him a compass and tells him to bring back the ones who left. To do that, he has to die. Locke has another time flash and Richard disappears.

Daniel soon realizes the flashes are having negative effects upon Charlotte, who suffers from a nosebleed. In a desperate plea for help, he contacts Desmond and tells him to find his mother in Oxford when he leaves the Island in three years time. When the castaways return to the beach, they are attacked by flaming arrows. They frantically escape into the jungle however over ten survivors are killed. Locke soon re-unites with Sawyer and Juliet who discover the Others attacked them, sometime in the distant past. They arrive at their camp where they have Daniel, Charlotte and Miles as prisoners. The Hostiles believe them to be American soldiers who have come to retrieve their bomb, which Daniel orders to be buried under concrete to shield its radiation. A time flash moves the castaways onwards where they re-unite in an empty field, but not before Locke discovers that one of the Hostiles happens to be Charles Widmore, the man who sent the freighter to find the Island in the first place. Charlotte faints momentarily and becomes increasingly ill.

Locke plans to stop the time flashes at the Orchid. On the way, the castaways see the hatch light in the sky and Sawyer witnesses Kate delivering Claire's baby. They reach the beach camp that has returned but it is deserted and appears to be ransacked, however there are two canoes with an Ajira water bottle. They take one and paddle to the other side of the Island and are shot at by unseen individuals in the other canoe. A time flash interrupts their plight.

Jin is discovered in the ocean by Danielle's french science team. After being revived, he realizes he has time-traveled back in time and witneses pivotal moments within their past, but eventually re-unites with the remaining castaways who trek to the Orchid. Charlotte collapses as the time flashes become increasingly violent, and Daniel stays behind with her. Charlotte reveals she met him as a child, that Daniel warned her not to return to the Island or otherwise she'd die. She then passes away. The others reach the Orchid. Jin orders Locke to not bring Sun back, and if she approaches Locke - to tell her he's dead and give his wedding ring as a proof. Locke accesses the frozen wheel by climbing down a well instead, but he breaks his leg in the process due to a fall because of another time flash. There, he encounters the apparition of Christian Shephard who instructs him to find Eloise Hawking in LA. Locke discovers the time flashes are happening because the wheel is off its axis, and then corrects it and is teleported to Tunisia in 2007.
Locke's mission (late 2007)
Locke appears in Tunisia three years after replacing the wheel on its axis. Widmore is monitoring the area and sends a team to collect Locke, fix his broken leg and take him to a hospital. There, Widmore agrees to help Locke on his mission to bring the Oceanic Six back to the Island. Locke adopts the pseudonym Jeremy Bentham and is accompanied by Matthew Abaddon, his driver and accomplice. Locke meets several survivors who have left the Island while Ben follows him:

Sayid in Santo Domingo refuses to accompany Locke back to the Island, choosing instead to repent for his sins by doing charity work there, and also because he was able to marry the woman he loved, giving him the best nine months of his life. Walt is visited by Locke but is not asked to go back. Hurley refuses to ally himself with Locke because he believes Abaddon to be a "bad guy". Kate believes Locke to be angry and obsessed about the Island, and won't come with him.
Locke eventually loses faith in his mission after learning of Helen's death. Ben shoots Abaddon whilst Locke escapes in a car, but collides with two others and is knocked unconscious. In hospital, he awakes to find Jack at his bedside. Jack is already indulging in substance abuse and alcoholism, and he believes Locke is a "sad, old man". Locke tries to convince Jack he saw his father on the Island, but Jack stubbornly refuses to believe him.

Having failed to convince any of the other survivors to return to the Island, and remembering Richard's claim that Locke would have to die in order for them to return there, Locke sits down at a table in his hotel room and writes a suicide note. He then tries to hang himself, but Ben knocks at the door and tries to stop him from doing so, telling him that he's important. After Locke gives Ben information regarding Eloise Hawking, Ben unexpectedly strangles him to death and hangs him up, to actually make it look like suicide. Once this is done, Ben covers his tracks and says to the now-deceased Locke, "I'll miss you, John. I really will."

Off the Island (2007)
Moments after the end of the previous season, Jack and Ben steal the body of Jeremy Bentham, now known to be John Locke, from the Hoffs/Drawlar funeral parlor, and go to a hotel, where they prepare to begin their mission to return to the Island. Meanwhile, Sayid and Hurley arrive at a safe house, and are attacked by two men. Sayid kills them but is shot in the neck with a dart that renders him unconscious, and Hurley takes Sayid to his parents' house, from which David Reyes takes Sayid to Jack at St. Sebastian Hospital, where Jack revives him. Ben arrives at the Reyes' house where Hurley is hiding, and implores Hurley to return to the Island, but Hurley instead runs and surrenders to police, claiming he killed the people at the safe house (earlier Sayid told him to do the opposite of what Ben ever says to do).

After three years on the run with Penny, now his wife, Desmond suddenly wakes up one morning with the memory of his meeting with Daniel Faraday while living at the Swan station, and takes Penny and their two-year-old son, Charlie, to Oxford, England, in search of Daniel's mother. Desmond's trail leads him to his father-in-law, Charles Widmore, who gives him an address in Los Angeles for Daniel's mother. Desmond returns to Penny, who agrees to go with him to Los Angeles to find her.

At about the same time, a lawyer named Dan Norton arrives at Kate's home requesting a blood sample to verify her relation to Aaron, and in England, Sun reveals to Charles Widmore that her common interests with him are to kill Benjamin Linus. The next day, Jack and Ben meet at St. Sebastian Hospital, where Sayid is again attacked by a man who, after Sayid renders him unconscious, is revealed to have Kate's address written on a slip of paper in his pocket. Jack calls Kate and asks to meet her, fearing for her safety. Kate is accompanied by Jack as she follows Dan Norton, and learns he is employed by Carole Littleton, Aaron's grandmother. Jack approaches Carole and learns she is not aware of Aaron and thus not trying to take him, and was merely receiving a settlement from Oceanic Airlines. That night, Jack and Kate meet with Ben and Sayid, revealing their plan to return to the Island. Sayid and Kate leave upon learning this, but Sun arrives and approaches the group, holding Ben at gunpoint, and on the verge of killing him when Ben reveals that Jin is still alive, and claims to be able to prove it, so he takes them to a woman who will show them how to return to the Island.

While Jack, Sun, and Ben drive away, Sayid goes to a bar and meets a woman there named Ilana. That night the two go to a hotel, where Sayid is attacked by Ilana, who claims to be working for the family of a man he killed, Mr. Avellino, and is going to take him to Guam. Jack, Sun and Ben arrive at a church, where Ben gives Sun Jin's wedding ring, which he took from Locke, as proof he is still alive. As they enter the church they are met by Desmond, and it is revealed this church is the location of Daniel Faraday's mother, Eloise Hawking, a mysterious woman Desmond met when he time-travelled after blowing The Hatch. Upon entering the church Eloise, who is disappointed Ben has not brought more members of the Oceanic Six, takes them below the church to a DHARMA Initiative station called the Lamp Post, which reveals the location of the Island. She tells them the only way to return to the Island is on Ajira Airways Flight 316, while recreating the circumstances of Oceanic Flight 815 as much as possible. Desmond refuses to return to the Island and promptly leaves, while Eloise takes Jack aside and gives him John Locke's suicide note which was addressed to him. Meanwhile, Kate's guilt overwhelms her, and she meets Carole Littleton, and gives her Aaron, revealing his true lineage to her, and promising to find Claire, and bring her back to raise him. She meets and reconciles with Jack, agreeing to return to the Island.

Concurrently, Hurley is released from jail after it is proved that he could not have committed the murders he confessed to, and he enters a taxi cab to take him away from the prison, and is met by a mysterious man who asks him to go back to the Island, telling him to board Flight 316 if he so chooses, and leaves him with a guitar case. On the morning of the Flight, Ben goes to the Long Beach Marina, where Desmond's boat is docked, and shoots Desmond in the chest, and is about to kill Penelope when he sees her son, Charlie, and lowers his gun, but is attacked and beaten by Desmond, and thrown into the water. Ben reaches a phone booth and calls Jack, asking him to bring Locke's body to the airport. Jack brings Locke's body and meets Hurley and Sun, and sees Sayid at the airport being escorted in handcuffs by Ilana, and upon boarding the plane, learns Sayid is being taken to Guam aboard Flight 316. He meets Kate on the plane, and at the last moment Ben boards as well, and the Flight takes off. A moment after takeoff, Jack learns that their pilot is none other than Frank Lapidus.

Meanwhile, Penny rushes Desmond to the hospital, where he nearly dies but is ultimately saved, and promises to never leave Penny again. On Flight 316, after a few hours in the air, Jack tells Ben he was given Locke's suicide note, and Ben advises Jack to read it, and leaves, giving him privacy. Jack reads the note which states "Jack, I wish you had believed me. JL." Immediately after Jack reads the note, the plane encounters heavy turbulence and after a moment is engulfed by a flash of bright light.

On the Island (1974–1977)
After Locke corrects the frozen wheel's axis, a large, intense, time flash occurs, permanently leaving Sawyer, Jin, Juliet, Miles, and Daniel in the year 1974. They soon encounter members of the DHARMA Initiative, who agree to let them stay for two weeks, which is ultimately extended to three years. Over those years Sawyer, now operating under the alias of "Jim LaFleur", becomes the DHARMA Head of Security, with Jin and Miles working under him as members of the Security team, Juliet takes a job in the motor pool, Daniel leaves the Island and begins working in the DHARMA Headquarters in Michigan doing research, and Sawyer and Juliet enter a committed relationship, moving in together.

In July of 1977, immediately following the flash on Flight 316, Jack wakes up in the jungle on the Island. After being reunited with Kate and Hurley, they are found by Jin, who calls Sawyer, who after revealing to the three that they have flashed to 1977, hastily assembles a plan to bring Jack, Kate, and Hurley in as members of the DHARMA Initiative, due to a group of new recruits being brought to the Island that day. The plan is successful and the three become members of DHARMA, with Jack working as a Workman, Kate as a member of the motor pool, and Hurley as a Chef. Later in the day it is discovered that Sayid time flashed to 1977 also, and he is found by Jin, who is forced to bring him in as a prisoner and presumed member of the Hostiles when another DHARMA member sees him also. That night in his cell, Sayid is brought a sandwich by a young Benjamin Linus.

The next day, Ben tells Sayid he can help him escape and return to the Hostiles, and Sayid is taken and interrogated by various members of the DHARMA Initiative, and ultimately reveals the truth that he is from the future, but his words are disregarded. That night, Ben breaks Sayid out of his cell, and after they make an escape into the jungle, Sayid shoots Ben in the chest and runs away, believing that by possibly killing him, he can ensure that Ben won't have the chance to grow up and hire him as a hitman, a job that Sayid openly admits he's uncomfortable doing for him. Ben is found by Jin, who returns him to the Barracks where he is cared for by Juliet. She is unable to save Ben however, and after Jack refuses to help, Kate and Sawyer take Ben into the jungle to the Hostiles, where he is taken by Richard Alpert into their Temple. Sawyer asks Miles to erase the Security tape showing them taking Ben into the jungle, but Miles is given an assignment by Horace Goodspeed, the leader of the DHARMA Initiative, and is unable to do so. The tape is found by Phil, another member of the Security team, who confronts Sawyer, and is attacked and tied up by him and Juliet.

That night, the submarine docks on the Island, and among the returnees is Daniel Faraday, who tells the group of his plan to detonate the Jughead bomb at the Swan construction site, avoiding the button protocol, and thus, the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. After his research in Michigan, he has come to believe that people are "Variables" in the equation of time, and thus would be able to alter the future via their deeds in the pass. After he finds Pierre Chang, and informs him that a severe electromagnetic incident will soon occur, Jack and Kate take him into the jungle to find his mother, Eloise, who is at the time a member of the Hostiles. However, the plan goes awry and Daniel is shot and killed by Eloise, and Jack and Kate are captured by Charles Widmore, who is at the time the leader of the Hostiles. Eloise goes through Daniel's belongings and finds a journal with her handwriting in it that she would give to Daniel some time later. Believing Jack, she agrees to help him as they carry out Daniel's plan to detonate the bomb. Accompanied by Richard Alpert, they set out to where the bomb was buried, per Daniel's orders, underneath the Barracks. Kate leaves the group to return to the Barracks and try to tell Sawyer to stop Jack, and Sayid finds the group, joining Jack in his mission to detonate the bomb.

Meanwhile, at the Barracks, Sawyer and Juliet are found out and interrogated by several members of the DHARMA Initiative, while Pierre orders an evacuation of non-essential personnel off the Island. In exchange for drawing a map to the Hostiles' camp, Sawyer and Juliet are allowed to leave the Island with the evacuees on the submarine. Just before the sub leaves, however, Kate arrives and boards, telling Sawyer and Juliet of Jack's plan, and the three leave the sub in an effort to stop him.
Jack, Sayid, Richard, and Eloise, reach an underground chamber where the Jughead has been concealed. Using Daniel's journal, Sayid removes the core of the bomb, and after breaking through a wall of the underground chamber, revealing the inside of a basement of a house inside the Barracks, Richard leaves with Eloise, and Jack and Sayid move forward. While attempting to sneak out of the barracks, a firefight ensues and Sayid is shot in the stomach by Roger Linus, Jack and Sayid are saved by Miles, Jin and Hurley in a DHARMA van, and set out for the Swan site.

Upon returning to the Island, Sawyer, Kate and Juliet encounter Rose and Bernard, who have been living in hiding on the Island the past three years. Rose and Bernard give them directions to the Barracks, and on the way the three encounter the DHARMA van being driven by Hurley, and Sawyer asks for a moment of Jack's time. After a brief debate about whether or not to destroy the bomb, with Sawyer opposing the idea, Jack and Sawyer engage in a brutal fight which is only broken up by Juliet, who decides that they should help Jack detonate the bomb.

With Kate's blessing, Jack sets out to the Swan site, and after they see a group of security team members going there, Kate, Sawyer, Juliet, and Miles follow him and aid him in shooting or otherwise incapacitating the various DHARMA workers there, and Jack drops the bomb into a deep drilling shaft, but the bomb does not immediately detonate, and a severe electromagnetic Incident occurs, pulling all metal objects to the shaft. A metal chain wraps around Juliet and pulls her toward the shaft, but she is saved by Sawyer who holds her dangling over the shaft. The chains continue to pull her down though, and after proclaiming their love for each other, Juliet falls down the shaft. After a moment she wakes up at the bottom of the shaft, badly injured, and sees the undetonated Jughead bomb. She begins hitting it with a rock, and on her eighth strike, the area is enveloped in a flash of light.
On the Island (2007)
Back in 2007, the flash of light that had enveloped the plane disappears and Frank and his co-pilot see the Island. Frank, seeing a landing strip on the Hydra Island, crash lands the plane. He goes back into the cabin where he finds Sun and Ben, with Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid nowhere to be found. When Ben realizes they are on the Hydra Island, he sets out for a small outrigger and is followed by Frank and Sun. Sun hits Ben with an oar, knocking him and unconscious, and she and Frank set out for the main Island, where they are met by an apparition of Christian Shephard, who instructs them to go to the Barracks and wait for John Locke if Sun ever wants to see Jin again.

The next night, survivors of the crash find a man who appears to be John Locke standing in the water. He is interrogated by Ilana and another survivor named Caesar, and tells them he remembers dying, having been killed by Ben, who is resting along with other injured survivors of the crash. Locke confronts Ben, who reveals he came back to the Island to be judged by the Monster. The next morning, Ben and Locke prepare to set out to the main island with another outrigger, and when they are confronted by Caesar, Ben kills him. Upon arriving to the Island, they find Frank and Sun at the Barracks, where Ben attempts to summon the Monster. Leaving Sun with Ben and Locke, Frank returns to the Hydra island where he is attacked by Ilana and a small group of other survivors, who set out to the main island with Frank, and a large metal cargo crate from the plane, in tow.
When the Monster does not come to the Barracks, Locke leads Ben and Sun to the wall of the Temple, under which the Monster resides. Ben descends and is judged by the Monster, which after showing him several critical moments from his past involving Alex, allows Ben to live under the condition that he follow John Locke and do whatever he says.

The three then set out for the Others' camp, where Locke speaks to Richard, and they set out to the beechcraft, where Locke instructs Richard to heal a wounded, time-flashing Locke, and tell him he has to die. After this, they return to the camp, where Locke takes leadership of the Others, and tells them he wants to take them to go see and meet Jacob. However, after they set out, Locke voices to Ben his intentions of killing Jacob.
Upon arriving at the Island, Ilana and her group set out to Jacob's cabin, and upon finding it abandoned, burn it down. Meanwhile, on their journey to Jacob, Ben reveals to Locke that he was told to follow his orders no matter what, and Locke reveals to Ben that he wishes him to kill Jacob. They arrive at Jacob's home, the four toed statue, and Locke and Ben go inside, Locke giving Ben a knife.

Meanwhile outside, Frank, Ilana, and her group, arrive at the statue as well, and Ilana meets Richard, revealing to him the contents of the metal cargo crate: the body of John Locke. Inside the statue, Ben and Locke meet Jacob. Locke is now revealed to be someone else entirely - an entity that lives on the Island for centuries along with Jacob and dreams of having him killed. Ben rants that he was always neglected by Jacob despite being always faithful to the Island, and after Jacob seems to neglect him again, Ben kills him in anger. Jacob's final words are to Man in Black: "They're coming." The Man in Black kicks him into the fire, leaving Jacob's body to burn, as he and Ben look on.

<p>
     Original timeline (2007)
The survivors, who had been stranded in 1977 awaken in the jungle just after the detonation of Jughead, and find that a resulting time flash has sent them to the present day. They find the Swan station's crater and hear Juliet under the wreckage. After using a DHARMA van to move the debris, they extricate her, but she is beyond medical help and soon dies in Sawyer's arms. Meanwhile, Jacob's ghost appeared to Hurley, and tells him to take Sayid and the others to the Temple, where he can be healed. Sawyer and Miles stay behind to bury Juliet. Miles tells Sawyer of Juliet's intended last words: "It worked."
As Hurley, Jack, Kate, Jin and Sayid reach the Temple, they are taken captive by the Others, who later capture and bring Sawyer and Miles there as well. Dogen, the Temple's leader, finds one of Jacob's lists hidden in an ankh in Hurley's guitar case, with each of their names on it. They take Sayid to be healed in a pool, which has at some recent point been muddied. The Others submerge Sayid in the muddied water and he drowns; they hold him under until a small hourglass empties. Sayid soon wakes up, gasping, "What happened?"
At the Statue, Ben comes out alone to get Richard. Richard shows Ben the dead body of Locke. Bram then grabs Ben and enters the Statue with his team, not including Ilana. The Man in Black then kills Bram and his team and exits the Statue. He knocks Richard unconscious and drags him off into the jungle, shocking Ben, Sun, Frank, Ilana, and the rest of the Others as they all watch on helplessly.
At the Temple, Sayid is tortured by Dogen. They determine that he has been "infected", or "claimed", and try to get Jack to give him a pill ground from some herbs. Jack is suspicious and attempts to take the pill himself, but Dogen kept him from swallowing it. He tells Jack that the pill is poison, and that Claire has been similarly "infected." Later, Hurley tells Dogen that Jacob is dead; as a result the Others scramble into action and prepare to defend their home. Sawyer leaves, securing his exit at gunpoint. Kate and Jin, with the help of two Others, go after him. However, Kate and Jin escape when Kate knocks out the two Others guarding them. Jin goes off on his own to look for Sun, while Kate tracks Sawyer down. Later, the two Others catch up to Jin. After arguing and Jin falling into a mysterious trap in the Jungle, the small group is confronted by the sudden appearance of a wild-looking and gun-toting Claire. Claire takes Jin to her hut where she has been living for three years. Later on, Claire's "friend", the Man in Black, stops by her camp. Elsewhere, Kate tracks Sawyer to DHARMA's submarine dock. Sawyer is distraught over the loss of Juliet and it appears he is finally over his love of Kate. They part ways.
Meanwhile, at the Statue, all the Others have left. Ilana collects Jacob's ashes, then she, Sun, Ben and Frank decide to bury Locke at the survivors' graveyard. At his funeral, Ben declares that he is "sorry that he murdered him." Meanwhile, The Man in Black lets Richard go when he says he does not want to join the Man in Black's "side." At the Barracks, Sawyer is recruited by the Man in Black in the appearance of John Locke. Sawyer sees through the disguise but agrees to go with him as the Man in Black promises to get him off the Island. The Man in Black leads James to a cave where he finds hundreds of names on the cave wall, most of which have been crossed out, except for 5; Shephard (Jack), Reyes (Hurley), Jarrah (Sayid), Ford (himself) and Kwon (either Jin or Sun).
The Ghost of Jacob appears to Hurley and convinces him to take Jack to the Lighthouse. There, Jack discovers hundreds of names on its wheel, most of them crossed out. Jack sees his childhood home in the mirrors of the lighthouse, which makes Jack so upset he shatters all of them. Later, Jacob tells Hurley that someone bad is coming to the Temple.
At the Temple, Dogen attempts to kill Sayid, but stops at the last second. He then tells Sayid to kill the Man in Black with a dagger. However, Sayid fails and then joins forces with the Man in Black . He tells all the people at the Temple that the Man in Black is leaving the Island and those who want to leave should join him before sundown, or be killed. When Kate returns to the Temple, she demands to see Claire. Kate reveals to Claire that she took Aaron off the Island. Sayid kills Dogen and Lennon. The Smoke Monster kills all the Others who did not join him. Miles is saved by Ilana, Frank, Sun, and Ben. Sayid, Claire and Kate then join the Man in Black. Elsewhere, Jack and Hurley continue their journey back from the lighthouse. They then bump into Richard, who tells them of the Massacre. Richard then leads them to the Black Rock, where he tries to kill himself, but fails because of Jacob's "touch."
After leaving the Temple, Ilana, Miles, Sun and Frank and Ben head towards to the Beach Camp. Ilana is suspicious of Ben, and asks Miles to read Jacob's ashes to see who really killed him, and Miles reveals it was Ben. Ilana forces Ben to dig his own grave as punishment for killing Jacob, but she later accepts his sincere apology. Later, Jack, Hurley and Richard arrive and are greeted by Ilana’s group. The group discuss who and what candidates are. Ilana states that Richard knows what to do next, although Richard gets angry and runs off. Hurley tracks him, and thanks to his ability to talk to the dead”, he speaks with his deceased wife, Isabella. Isabella tells Richard and Hurley to stop the Man in Black leaving the Island, or “we all go to hell”. The two return to the beach camp. Sun is in her garden, and the Man in Black confronts her, asking her to join his team. However, Sun runs away, bashing her head in the process. Because of that, she gets aphasia; she can't speak English but can understand it.
The Man in Black’s group arrive at Claire’s Hut. The Man in Black tells Sawyer to visit the Hydra Island, to find out information on the Ajira survivors. He discovers them all to be dead. He finds a woman, Zoe, who is really working for Charles Widmore, who has a submarine on the Island. She takes Sawyer to him, and Sawyer tells Widmore he will bring the Man in Black to him, so Widmore can kill him. Later, he tells all this to the Man in Black. At night, he tells Kate that they are going to steal the submarine and leave. The next day, Claire attempts to kill Kate. Sayid watches unconcerned, and the Man in Black pulls Claire off. Later, Claire apologized for her actions, and they hug, with Claire sobbing on Kate’s shoulder. Later, they are all ambushed by Widmore’s team, who take Jin to Room 23. There, Charles Widmore says that if they don’t stop the Man in Black from leaving the Island, everyone will die. Jin agrees to help Widmore. The Man in Black sends Sayid to see what the package is, and it is revealed to be Desmond.
Desmond wakes up, extremely angry at Widmore for bringing him back to the Island. Widmore and his team are experimenting with electromagnetism. One of Widmore's team is fried as the machine is accidentally turned on when he is in the room. Desmond is then taken to the room to be tested to make sure he can survive an electromagnetic event. He has flashes into the flash sideways timeline. After he wakes up, he is ready to help Widmore and do his "mission." Sayid then ambushes Desmond, Zoe and two other people in the jungle. He kills the two men, lets Zoe run and asks Desmond to come with him. Desmond confidently agrees.
At the Beach Camp, the survivors debate on whether or not to stop the Man in Black from leaving the island by destroying the Ajira plane with dynamite. Ilana gets dynamite from the Black Rock, but is killed when she handles it carelessly. The remaining survivors trek to the Black Rock to get more dynamite, but Hurley destroys it all, along with the ship, after being warned by Michael's ghost that the plan to blow up the plane will get a lot of people killed. The group then divides, with Richard, Ben, and Miles electing to continue the plan to destroy the plane by using grenades from the barracks, while, under the leadership of Hurley, Jack, Sun, and Frank decide to go to the Man in Black to talk things out.
Meanwhile, Sayid brings the Man in Black to Desmond, and the Man in Black puts him in a strange old well. En route they encounter a strange boy, but the Man in Black insists that they ignore him. When he returns to camp, the Man in Black is met with the arrival of Jack, Hurley, Sun, and Frank. The Man in Black tries to convince Jack to join him, and Jack and Claire meet for the first time after learning they are siblings. Sawyer and Kate inform Hurley and Sun of their plan to escape the Island on Widmore's submarine. Zoe arrives at the camp and demands that the Man in Black return Desmond. The Man in Black decides to begin the journey to Hydra Island. Sawyer is ordered to get the sailboat Elizabeth and pick up the Man in Black and his followers to make the trip. Sawyer brings Kate with him and tells Jack to sneak away with Sun, Hurley, and Frank and meet him at the boat. They do so, but are followed by Claire. She joins them on the Elizabeth as they betray the Man in Black and head to Hydra Island without him. On board, Jack decides to abandon the group and jump overboard. The group reaches Hydra Island and is confronted by Zoe and some armed men. Jin and Sun are reunited after three years apart, and Sun's aphasia is gone. Zoe and the gunman order the survivors to their knees, going back on the deal Sawyer made with Widmore. Widmore's group then begins firing artillery at the main island. Sawyer, Kate, Hurley, Claire, Jin, Sun, and Frank are taken to the cages on Hydra Island. Sawyer protests, but gives in when Widmore threatens to kill Kate.
Meanwhile, the Man in Black orders Sayid to kill Desmond, who is still in the well. Later, The Man in Black returns to pick up Sayid, and Sayid tells him that he has killed Desmond. At the rendezvous point, The Man in Black welcomes Jack as he completes his swim back to the main island. Widmore's artillery attack begins, and the Man in Black drags Jack to safety. Jack wakes up on Hydra Island with Sayid and the Man in Black. The Man in Black turns into the smoke monster and attacks the guards at the cages, killing several. Jack frees the captive survivors, and they meet up with Sayid. Together they head to the Ajira Plane. At the plane, The MiB kills two guards and discovers that the plane has been rigged with C4. He tells everyone that Widmore put the C4 there, intending to kill them all. He advises they leave on the sub instead. The survivors lay siege to the sub and board it. Just as Jack pushes The MiB into the water to stop him from boarding, they are interrupted by Widmore's men. Kate is shot, Jack rushes to help her, and they board the sub. Claire and The MiB kill all of the gunmen, but are left behind as the sub leaves the dock and dives.
Aboard the sub, Jack discovers the C4 in his pack, set to detonate. Jack tries to convince Sawyer not to disarm it, believing that the MiB cannot kill them. Sawyer disarms it anyway, and the timer speeds up. With only seconds till it detonates, Sayid picks up the C4, tells Jack that Desmond is alive and where to find him, then heroically charges to the other end of the sub. The C4 detonates, killing Sayid, but sparing the rest of them. Water breaches the sub, and Frank is hit with a metal door as it gives away under the pressure of the water. As the sub floods, Sun is trapped behind debris. Hurley and Kate escape the sub. Sawyer is knocked out by a piece of flying debris. Jin convinces Jack to save Sawyer and leave while he continues trying to free Sun. She tells him save himself, but Jin remains by her side as the sub goes down; they die together.
Back on the beach, Jack, Kate, and Hurley are moved to tears as the loss of their friends sinks in. Meanwhile, the Man in Black tells Claire that the sub has sunk, but that not everyone died. He sets off to finish what he started.
Jack stitches up Kate's gunshot wound on the beach, as Hurley and Sawyer watch the remains of the submarine blast wash ashore. Kate and Jack agree they must kill the Man in Black, but first the four set off to find Desmond in the well, per Sayid's instructions. On the way there, Hurley encounters the mysterious boy (young Jacob), who demands the bag of his ashes which Hurley has. Hurley gives him the ashes, then chases after him, only to find adult Jacob sitting by a burning fire. Jacob instructs Hurley to bring Jack, Kate, and Sawyer to him, which he does. When they arrive, Jacob explains that they only have until the fire burns out before they never see him again. Jacob explains why they were brought to the island and that he is responsible for what happened to the Man in Black. He tells them that one of them must choose to become his replacement to guard the island. Jack immediately volunteers. Jacob takes Jack into the woods, where he whispers a phrase in Latin over a cup of water from the stream, which Jack drinks. Jacob tells Jack that they are now the same. Jacob tells the others that they will have to figure out how to kill the Man in Black, before he kills them.
Ben, Richard, and Miles trek through the jungle to retrieve the C4 Ben has hidden at the barracks. They reach Ben's house to retrieve the C4, which he has hidden in a safe in the secret room behind the bookcase. While in the secret room, they hear something in the kitchen, and discover that Charles Widmore and Zoe have arrived as well. Widmore explains that he was invited back to the island by Jacob, and that he already has wired the Ajira plane with explosives. He sends Zoe down to the dock to sink the outrigger, where she discovers Locke returning from Hydra Island and warns the others by walkie-talkie. Widmore and Zoe hide in Ben's secret room. Ben asks for their walkie-talkies; he gives one to Miles, who runs into the jungle alone. Ben and Richard go outside to wait for the Man in Black. He arrives, in smoke form, grabbing Richard by the throat and slamming him into a tree before punting him into the jungle. Then he appears as Locke and tells Ben that he needs him to kill some people for him, offering the leadership of The Island instead when he ("Locke") leaves. Ben agrees, and gives up the location of Widmore and Zoe. The Man in Black and Ben confront Widmore in the secret room, and the Man in Black slits Zoe's throat. Widmore reveals to the Man in Black that Desmond is Jacob's failsafe to keep the Man in Black on the island. The two whisper for a moment, and Ben shoots Widmore three times, killing him. Ben and the MiB go to the well, where they find that Desmond has already been rescued by someone else. The Man in Black then tells him that he wants to use Desmond to "destroy the island."
Jack, Kate and Hurley then trek to the Heart of the Island while Sawyer heads to rescue Desmond. Sawyer gets caught by Ben while spying on The Man in Black, quickly gets away, telling the MiB that he is "no longer a candidate." The Man in Black then spots dog tracks. Rose, Bernard and Vincent are revealed to be the ones who rescued Desmond. The Man in Black and Ben then arrive and take Desmond. Meanwhile, Miles finds Richard and attempt to contact Ben by walkie-talkie. Richard awakens and the two trek off to Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira Flight 316. On the way to Hydra Island, they encounter the wreckage of the submarine explosion and rescue Frank in the process. Rather than blow up the plane, the three decide to pilot it off the Island.
Sawyer catches up with Jack's group, and tells him MiB's plan of using Desmond to destroy the island. Jack and MiB then meet, prompting Kate to shoot at MiB; the bullets pass through him. He walks up to Jack and confirms that it is he who is now the Island's protector. The two argue about what will happen when they reach the Source: Jack believes he will kill the MiB, and MiB believes he will destroy the Island. Jack, MiB, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, Ben, and Desmond all head toward the Source. When the group gets close, Locke draws his knife and says it should just be him, Jack and Desmond from here on. Hurley steps up to Jack and says "I believe in you, dude." Outside the Source, Desmond tells Jack that this - killing Locke and destroying the Island - doesn't matter, because once he goes into the cave, he'll go to another place where they can be with the ones they love. Jack replies that he already tried that and that all of this matters. Jack and Locke begin to lower Desmond into the brilliant abyss. The Man in Black notes the similarity between this moment and when they (Jack & Locke) found the Swan station hatch. Jack insists that John was right about almost everything, and wished he got to tell him this when he was still alive. The two continue to argue until Desmond reaches the bottom. Desmond walks through a chamber below, passing several skeletons. He finds the Source, a glowing pool, filled by a small waterfall, with an elongated stone cork at its center. He enters the water as electromagnetic energy emanates. He reaches the center stone and lifts it. The stream from the waterfall stops, the electromagnetic force recedes, the light goes out, the pool dries up and there is a red hot glow emitting from the center. Desmond screams "No!" as an earthquake begins to destroy the Island. Jack chases Locke out of the cave in a fit of fury, punching him in the mouth and jumping on him when he falls. Locke bleeds from the mouth, and the two realize that they are mortal again. Locke finds a rock and hits Jack over the back of the head with it, and gets up and runs off.
The outrigger has reached Hydra island. Miles calls Ben, who is sitting with Sawyer, Kate, and Hurley. Miles informs him they're going to fly off the Island and that Sawyer's group should get to Hydra Island soon. Claire emerges from the bushes and hold's Miles' group at gunpoint and shoots into the sand. Through the walkie talkie, Kate hears that Claire is there. Claire assumes Locke has sent them there to kill her. To convince her this isn't the case, Richard tells her they can go home and be free of Locke. He invites Claire to join them but she refuses and leaves. As the quakes continue, Ben notices a large tree starting to fall and pushes Hurley out of the way, but the tree pins Ben down. Miles radios in that Frank is fixing the plane and they should get over there quickly. He also tells Kate that Claire is around but won't come. Ben says he knows how they can get to Hydra Island - that Locke has a boat.
The Man in Black stands on the cliff above the cliffside cave. The Elizabeth is anchored a short distance offshore. Before he can make it to the boat, Jack catches up to him. The two face each other for the final showdown. The two fight, and during the struggle the MiB picks up his knife and stabs Jack fatally under the rib cage. ♪ As the MiB tries to finish him off, Kate shoots him from behind. Jack stands up and kicks the Man in Black off the cliff to his death. Sawyer, Hurley, and Ben join Jack and Kate as the earthquakes continue. Ben says they should sail to Hydra island with MiB's boat. Jack, Hurley, and Ben decide to stay and attempt to undo what Desmond did, while Kate and Sawyer decide to sail to Hydra Island. The two groups share a final goodbye and part ways.
Meanwhile, Frank, Miles, and Richard prepare the plane. Kate and Sawyer swim ashore to Hydra Island and find a disconsolate Claire sitting on the beach as the Island continues to disintegrate. As the plane begins to take-off, Kate convinces Claire to join them and the three spring towards the runway. As Frank begins to accelerate, Kate, Sawyer, and Claire enter the runway and get on board the plane as it prepares to leave.
Hurley helps Jack make it to the Source. Jack tells Hurley that he will have to protect the Island now. Jack performs the same ceremony to Hurley and Jacob did to him in order to become the Island's protector. Ben and Hurley lower Jack into the Source, where he finds Desmond and carries him back to the rope so Hurley and Ben can retrieve him. Desmond asks Jack what will happen to him, and Jack replies that he'll see him "in another life, brother." Jack restores the stone cork at the cost of his life. The light returns and the water begins to flow again. Outside the Source, Ben consoles Hurley about Jack's immanent death. Hurley asks Ben to be his number two on the Island, and Ben accepts.
Jack awakens in a creek outside of the Source. Knowing that his life is ending, he slowly finds his way back to the bamboo grove. As he does, he passes by the white shoe, now worn, still hanging from the branch. He collapses in the same spot he awoke after the crash of Flight 815. Vincent lies down beside him. The Ajira plane then soars overhead, and he smiles, closing his eyes.
