  <h1>LOST Season Recap (Seasons 1 - 6)</h1>
  <p>Once the surviving passengers of Oceanic Flight 815 cleaned off the blood and sand from their horrific crash landing on a South Pacific island, their traumatic journey truly began. Our disparate group of castaways — led by spinal surgeon Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) — discovered that help wasn't coming for them (WTF? A 16-year-old looped distress signal in French?), but some kind of monster was. And the waves of absurdity kept washing ashore. Why is Jack seeing visions of his dead father? Why are Hurley's (Jorge Garcia) lottery numbers popping up on the Island? Why are the Others, those creepy Islanders, trying to abduct pregnant Claire (Emilie de Ravin)? Who's this wild lady claiming that the Others stole her baby? For every secret born on the Island, there was a flashback-framed mystery tucked into the pocket of one of our characters. Why was Kate (Evangeline Lilly) running from the law? What painful truth was contained in Sawyer's (Josh Holloway) letter? And why is John Locke growing stronger and wiser? Much of the drama revolved around the castaways' struggles to build a life on this cursed patch of paradise while figuring out a way to escape it (Oh no, someone torched the raft!). In the finale, we felt a chill as the Others snatched Malcolm David Kelley's Walt ("We're going to have to take the boy") and a rush of wonder as the castaways blew open the mystery hatch with dynamite from the Black Rock ship marooned in the jungle. The reveal? A broken ladder leading down into…gotta wait till next season? C'mon!</p>
  <p>After blowing open the Hatch and finding a guy named Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) living inside, the survivors began unraveling the much larger enigma beneath that door in the jungle floor: the Dharma Initiative. This communal research project dating back to the 1970s seemed to encompass a broad swath of scientific disciplines, from psychology to electromagnetism to zoology, according to training films in the Hatch. More specifically, Dharma had Desmond convinced he must enter the magic numbers — 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 — into a computer every 108 minutes to stop the station from blowing up. Whether or not this was truly necessary was the subject of much faith-versus-reason debate for John Locke. Turned out (oops!) it was necessary — which we found out after the thing blew to bits in the finale. Of course, along the way, there were complications on all fronts. The original survivors reunited with the tail-section passengers, who'd been fighting for their own existence across the Island under the leadership of scrappy ex-cop Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez). The merging of the tribes brought some good (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's drug dealer-turned-priest Mr. Eko; Rose's long-lost husband, Bernard, played by Sam Anderson), some bad (Maggie Grace's Shannon was accidentally shot by Ana Lucia), and some debatable (the relatively useless Libby, played by Cynthia Watros). The Others were a confusing threat (what was with all the swiping of kids and sneaking around the jungle?) — led by a shifty guy named Ben Linus, who first identified himself as waylaid ballooner Henry Gale. The mind games came to a head when the Others manipulated Michael into shooting Ana Lucia and Libby, then bringing Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley to their camp under the guise of "rescuing" Walt. By season's end, Walt and Michael were sailing off to safety; the Others were holding Jack, Kate, and Sawyer prisoner; and Hurley was set free to report back to his fellow survivors.</p>
  <p>It was the season that pitted the castaways against the Others — and Lost against its fans. The fake Henry Gale was revealed to be Benjamin Linus, an ex-Dharma dude who gassed his own people (and his bad dad) to impress the Others and their ageless steward, Richard Alpert (Néstor Carbonell). Ben's season-long scheme: to remedy the Others' inexplicable inability to reproduce by abducting the castaway women. His co-conspirator in the effort was Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), a brilliant fertility doctor who fell for Jack and switched teams. Meanwhile, Locke, Desmond, and Mr. Eko survived the Hatch explosion — but Mr. Eko was felled by Smokey, and Desmond began seeing prophetic flashes of Charlie's death. Desmond's dilemma: Save Charlie, or let him die to fulfill a future that would bring Penny to the Island? Meanwhile, Sawyer and Kate got carnal in a polar bear cage at an old Dharma station. Weird-sexy! In a flashback, Jack got carnal with Achara (Bai Ling) in Thailand. Crappy, not sexy! Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) appeared, then died. Whatever! Oh, and Sun (Yunjin Kim) learned that sperm-challenged Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) knocked her up after all. (Whew!) Egged on by Alpert to usurp Ben as King Other, Locke tried to prove himself by getting Sawyer to kill his father, Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe). Locke's prize: a brief meeting with Jacob's alleged ghost — and a gunshot to the gut by jealous Ben. Jack foiled Ben's seize-the-dames gambit, then hailed Penny's freighter to the Island — except as Charlie learned moments before his heroic death, the freighter wasn't Penny's ship. Then, the brain-pocalypse: a flash-forward twist ending. Jack and Kate escaped the Island!? Jack's a junkie!? Jack wants to go back to the Island!?</p>
  <p>With Charles Widmore's (Alan Dale) freighter firmly anchored off the Island, our castaways had never been more divided: Those siding with Jack believed the boat would deliver them from their Island hell, and those with Locke feared it would bring certain doom. Turned out both camps were right. Flash-forwards into the future revealed only a half dozen of the Oceanic Flight 815 survivors ultimately made it off the Island. Strangers still, this "Oceanic 6" told the world they were the only survivors, and that lie propelled them into some not-so-happy places. Jack turned to pills and booze; Kate tried to raise Claire's son, Aaron, as her own; Hurley checked back into the psychiatric hospital after dead people started talking to him; believing Jin dead, Sun gave birth to their daughter, Ji Yeon, alone; and Sayid (Naveen Andrews) became an assassin for — wait, Ben?! Back on the present-day Island, people had reached their limits, and things came thrillingly, tragically undone. Ben tried to work his wily mojo on a team of mercenaries from the freighter, only to watch them execute his adopted daughter, Alex (Tania Raymonde). Locke decamped with his crew to New Otherton, awaiting guidance from the Island that never came. And as Jack watched his friends second-guess his leadership, his own body rebelled against him, forcing Juliet to perform a gross emergency appendectomy. Sacrifices abounded. Fractured and frightened, the castaways scrambled to get to the freighter, only to discover a massive load of C4 explosives; the boat exploded, with Jin still aboard. Sawyer leaped from a fuel-starved chopper so Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sun, Sayid, and Aaron could escape. (They did, and agreed to lie to protect their friends still on the Island.) And seemingly on instructions from unseen Island guru Jacob, Ben volunteered to turn a frozen donkey wheel deep underground, which banished him from his beloved home and ushered in the season's…</p>
  <p>This was the season that Lost really let its geek flag fly. It began with the Island breaking loose from the grooves of reality and the Left Behinders time traveling randomly through Island history. Along the way, Charlotte's brain melted in a series of nasty nosebleeds. John Locke ended the quantum crisis by cranking the donkey wheel and parking his friends in the 1970s Dharma compound. From there, the chief villains of the Lost saga took control. Charles Widmore and Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan) — ex-lovers, former leaders of the Others, and Daniel Faraday's (Jeremy Davies) parents — maneuvered the Oceanic adults (plus Ben and Jeff Fahey's Frank Lapidus) back to the Island on Ajira Flight 316, with Locke's corpse in tow. (Shocker! Off the Island, a jealous Ben had murdered him.) Via mysterious magic, Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid landed in the Dharma days. Shocker! Sawyer and Juliet had fallen in love and were playing house! Meanwhile, Lapidus, Sun, and Ben ended up in 2007. Shocker! Locke was alive!? Nah. He was actually a shape-shifting Island entity bent on manipulating Ben into killing the elusive and seemingly saintly Jacob, who had touched various castaways at key moments in their lives. Fun Jacob facts! He was served by an off-Island cult of zealots, led by sexy soldier Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson), who also crashed on the Ajira flight. He lived within the remains of the Statue, which used to be a towering edifice modeled after an Egyptian fertility goddess. Back in 1977, the castaways attempted to save themselves by altering history, with mixed results. Sayid tried to murder young Ben. Fail! Queen Other Eloise Hawking, pregnant with Faraday, killed adult Faraday — a tragedy she had hoped her son would figure out how to avert. Fail! Jack — who returned to the Island a man of faith in search of his destiny — became convinced that his purpose was to change the future by detonating a hydrogen bomb at the Hatch site, a volatile spring of electromagnetic energy. After falling into the work site, and with what seemed to be her dying breath, Juliet banged on the bomb to make it explode. Fail?</p>
  <p>The explosion of Jughead changed nothing. The explosion may have changed everything. Huh? This season has seemingly explored both options, creating two shows in one. In the parallel world, Oceanic 815 never crashed and the passengers have different lives. Jack's a divorced father. Locke is engaged to Helen (Katey Sagal). Sawyer's a cop. Jin and Sun are secretly dating. Sayid "translates contracts," whatever that means. Ben is…a schoolteacher?! The Sideways world took a turn when Desmond — right-hand man to Charles Widmore — began remembering his Island life after a near-death experience, facilitated by a similarly enlightened Charlie. Desmond is now trying to get all his old Island friends to recall their castaway selves. Will he succeed in his mission? And what do these awakenings really mean? We'll see. Meanwhile, in the Jughead-changed-nothing world, the castaways were transported to the present-day Island and sought refuge inside the Temple, at least until Fake Locke got born-again-bad Sayid to kill its guardians, allowing him to ransack the Island's sacred heart. Fake Locke's mission: to kill Jacob's potential replacements (Jack, Sayid, Sawyer, Hurley, and the Kwons) so he can escape the Island. Dead so far: Jin, Sun, and Sayid. Though Fake Locke has our heroes on the run, he does have another enemy to contend with: Charles Widmore, who returned to the Island along with a new Zen Desmond. What's Widmore's grand purpose in the Island endgame? What's the backstory on the Jacob/Man in Black rivalry? And what's the final fate of the castaways? The end of Lost shall make all things clear — or so we hope.</p>
