<div class="intro">
  <p>Lost is an American serial drama television series that predominantly follows the lives of the survivors of the crash of Oceanic 815 on a mysterious tropical island. There, they had to negotiate with an unknown monster, a savage group of natives, polar bears, and each other as they tried to survive and seek rescue; for as they cannot live together, they would die alone. Lost's success comes primarily down to its multinational ensemble cast, the plotline of mysteries, flashbacks, flash-forwards and flash-sideways and the "mystery box" formula. Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse served as showrunners and are executive producers along with JJ Abrams and Bryan Burk. Inspired by the 2000 film Cast Away, the show is told in a heavily serialized manner. Due to its large ensemble cast and the cost of filming primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii, the series was one of the most expensive on television, with the pilot alone costing over $14 million (resulting in the firing of the ABC Executive who green-lit it). The fictional universe and mythology of Lost were expanded upon by several related media - most importantly a series of mini-episodes called Missing Pieces, an ARG Video Game; and a 12-minute epilogue, "The New Man in Charge". Lost has regularly been ranked by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. The first season had an estimated average of 16 million viewers per episode on ABC. Despite averaging around 11 million viewers per episode in the sixth season, the series finale ("The End") saw 13.5 million people tune in. Despite its successes, Lost is one of the most misunderstood pieces of media to ever exist, as we will explore together.</p></div>
